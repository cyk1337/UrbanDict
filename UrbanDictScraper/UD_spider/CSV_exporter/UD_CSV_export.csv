76870,E,"Short form for ecstasy. Ecstasy refers to MDMA, however most modern day ecstasy is just MDA or MDEA. MDMA is a party drug used by some who attend raves, clubs, concerts, spiritual sessions, etc. MDMA is not very physically addicting, however it depletes seritonin at a rapid rate which causes the high. This causes the user to feel depressed for a period of time after taking the drug. Heavy abuse of the drug has been proven to cause permanent brain damage (not government endorsed). Brain damage may be avoided by moderation and the use of seritonin building supplments such as 5HTP. MDMA was found to have very positive psychological qualities during medical testing but the fact it could be abused is what caused it to be banned."

1308223,E,"A slang term for the drug MDMA, also known as ecstasy, x, Emos, e-mazing, or the love drug. E comes in pills, gell caps, or liquid form. Pure MDMA is extremely hard to come by, and most E is part MDMA, part speed/coke/meth/heroine. The effects are different depending on what kind of E it is (what is in it other than MDMA). I'd say this is my drug of choice, just because the trip is awesome. It can be very obvious that you're tripping on it, though, as your pupils pretty much swallow your eyes, you usually talk a lot and very fast, and people usually grind their teeth or do other repetitive actions with, most often, their jaws and fingers. A loss of appetite is also experienced. E is pressed into different amounts in pill form: single-stacked, double-stacks, and triple-stacks. If you don't want to become a burnout E-tard, I'd recommend spacing out your E trips; Popping E too often can result in loss of memory, lack of intelligence, and eventually your brain will be fried. E can be taken orally (popping/dropping E), or the pill-form can be ground up and inhaled through the nose (bucking/snorting). When popped, E takes anywhere from a half hour to 2 hours to kick in, give or take. Bucking E kicks the trip in faster, but the effects also wear off faster. The average E trip lasts around 4 to sometimes up to 8 hours. The crash is horrible, though: depression, stupidity, slowness, exhaustion, sometimes dizziness and sickness. I'd say the coming down is well worth the trip, however."
1289062,E,"n. A drug (Ecstasy or MDMA) widely used by individuals who attend raves. It's effects give the user a rush of emotional happiness. E releases a chemical called serotonin into the brain which cause most people to open their thoughts and feelings without hesitation. Ecstasy is the choice of drug in the Asian scene and makes girls horny as fuck. However, a male under the influence of ecstasy may become temporarily impotent."

A loosely defined organization of late teen early twenty-year-olds would throw keg parties during the weekend evenings in the open wooded areas which are now McMansion ghettos. After the third half keg was half empty and all the ""T"" as in ""HC"" or other similar consumables were, well, consumed, there usually a chanting in unison of ""O.B.D.A"", almost as a wolf pack howling at the moon at 3 am. This meant that the O.B.D.A. meeting was in session and all were present and accounted for. There were no dues except to live in Old Bridge and to be recognized as cool and not a narc. The ""meetings"" were spontaneous and sometimes occurred simultaneously at different locations around the town. One faction were known as Lake People and preferred to chant O.B.D.A. by a huge fetid and weed strewn lake famous for the lead content from a nearby factory. Another faction partied at ""Paradise"" which was a pine wooded encampment near by a youth football athletic field. Still one more faction held ""The Pink Flamingo"" as their home stomping ground. The Pink Flamingo was an underground wood an earthen structure designed as a party spot and so named because it was painted pink on the inside. The area nearby the Flamingo was famous for tire fires in snowstorms and kegs held in the crotch of two trees packed in snow. The beer had to be ""The King of Beers"" to be an official meeting. Contrary to popular belief, O.B.D.A. did not mean Old Bridge Drug Addicts, although the members behavior would lead you to believe that permutation. Graffiti consisting of 5 foot tall O.B.D.A letters were frequent sights on liquor stores and Seven-Eleven brick walls. O.B.D.A. was frequently shouted from moving cars open windows especially if NP (non-partying) Jocks were walking along the street. The ""meeting"" of the of O.B.D.A. has dwindled due to its association with taste in classic and southern rock. The urban influence of rap and hip-hop has caused a decrease of binge consumption of beer in the woods. That combined with the associated O.B.D.A. uniform of flannel shirts, Levis and work boots, the yelling O.B.D.A at the top of your lungs in the middle of the night while piss-drunk has fallen into disfavor. I'm sure that somewhere in Central Jersey, there still is a guy with long scragglely grey hair in a bandana wearing the O.B.D.A. uniform, drinking a six at 3 am on a Saturday night trying to yell O.B.D.A., but smoking stogies through his trach tube makes it difficult to form words let alone yell."

6493811,Ozumba,"A last name commonly possessed by a rare subspecies of supreme homosapien, chiefly characterized by their titan-like physiques and seemingly infinite cognitive capabilities. Ozumbas sensory mechanisms are unequivocally heightened, often causing them to be mistaken by many for Superheroes (whom, unlike Ozumbas, do not exist). Ozumbas also exhibit extraordinarily high degrees of compassion, humility, kindness and courage. These, in combination with their outstanding ability to utilize reason and fair judgement, enable them to be effective and well-honored magistrates in their social environments.There are many myths and legends which attribute even more superfluous characteristics to Ozumbas. To date, however, contemporary archaeological and ancient historical research has yielded very little doubt among respective communities that any of these descriptions constitute an accurate representation of them in reality. Many scholars believe that Ozumbas are the greatest beings to have ever walked the planet."

3579910,Ozpop,"Ozpop refers to the underappreciated indie pop-rock scene in Australia that flourised from the post-punk late 1970s till the onslaught of grunge in the early 1990s. Though encompassing a large degree of diversity, there's a certain subtle commonality to many Ozpop bands. A sense of doomed romanticism, an understated machismo and an openness to the influence of folk, punk, pub rock and even electronic can be heard in many bands of the era. Ozpop band's isolation, both geographically and in the music media, is seen to have encouraged a timelessness grounded in real life rather than the MTV-fuelled fantasies and fads that prevailed in England and America at the same period such as hair metal and new romanticism. Australian groups such as The Apartments, The Birthday Party, The Church, Crime + the City Solution, Died Pretty, The Go-Betweens, Hoodoo Gurus, Hunters & Collectors, INXS, Killer Sheep, Laughing Clowns, The Lime Spiders, Midnight Oil, Paul Kelly, Plug Uglies, Primitive Calculators, Sacred Cowboys, The Saints, The Scientists, The Stems, These Immortal Souls, The Triffids and Young Charlatans can all be viewed (with an appropriate resistance to pigeonholing) as fine Ozpop bands. Ozpop occurred against the backdrop of the larger Australian cultural movement known as ""Cool Australis,"" wherein figures like Crocodile Dundee, Mad Max, Yahoo Serious rose to prominence, in part fueled by a strange, superficial and ultimately short-lived American fascination with some of the more stereotypical aspects of Australia. Although a few bands were able to expand their popularity to other parts of the world, most remain criminally underrated and totally under-heard. Whereas Scottish neo-pop, Kiwi Rock (and the Dunedin sound) received a fair amount of press (and rightfully so), Ozpop remains obscure and has never been the subject of serious study."

Currently run by a Kiwi, the University of Oxford enters the 21st Century much as it entered the 19th; with the sound of grumbling old men in leather chairs, some beautifully-manicured lawns and the eternal whiff of institutional homosexuality.

1169317,obeeja,"From Kaptain Mordant lore, obeeja is used to refer to anything spooky or evil. The word should be used sparingly, as uttering it can stir up evil around the speaker. When the word is mentioned, all parties within hearing distance must do the 'obeeja motion' as quickly as possible. The last person to complete this motion is then informed by everyone else that they are 'out the club.' This ritual is thought to help ward off evil that may be aroused by use of the spooky word. The word 'obeeja' originated somewhere around El Dorado, Arkansas on a dark, stormy night. Two members of Kaptain Mordant were driving along a back road when they encountered a mysterious young man on a moped. He was black with a slight build and piercing eyes, and was cloaked in a rain poncho as he rode along in the storm. After keeping pace with them for a short distance, the young man turned his head toward the car and gave them an eerie stare while making a strange motion with his right hand. He lifted his hand from the handlebar, shook it forward and then jerked it back as the sleeve of his poncho danced about his arm. This arm movement is now refered to as 'the obeeja motion.' The Kaptain Mordant members then sped off, never knowing what spell the young man had tried to cast on them, only that 'he was doing some sort of voodoo or obeeja or something.' The word 'obeeja' then stuck around."

1845380,objectivism,"The philosophical ideals populated by Ayn Rand that a man (or woman) is only entitled to what he has earned. It also promotes the right to life, a life free from carrying the burden of others. It deplores racism as being ""the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism."" It promotes the idea that life ""can be kept in existence only by a process of self-sustaining action"" and therefore a person cannot live a life of stagnation as a second-hander. It states that one loves another for their virtues, and not their character flaws. It promotes rational and fair thought above all else, ""A man is to be judged by the judgments he pronounces."" It stresses pure morality as a supreme goal even though it’s difficult. It denounces force as a means to make a man do anything. All actions require the voluntary consent of those involved. It states that the purpose of the government is to protect men from criminals, protect men from foreign invaders, and to settle disputes according to objective laws. It promotes capitalism as the best system thus far because it ""entails a constant process of motion, growth and progress."" It supports the idea that sex should only be shared between two people who fully accept each other. And if this is taken as seriously as it is meant to be, it is a stricter limitation than that set forth by religion as it is practically a miracle that you find some that you fully accept. Suggested reading: The Virtue of Selfishness (where the above quotes are taken from), Atlas Shrugged, and The Fountainhead (though she has written many other works)."
2131578,Objectivism,"An American poetic movement that emerged from the Imagist school of poetry in the 1930's. Influenced by early Modernist poets such as Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, H.D., and William Carlos Williams (who is also considered an Objectivist poet), the Objectivist poets utilized free verse, dense, concentrated language, and imagery. However, the Objectivist school of poetry rejected the Imagist's interest in Classicism and mythology, choosing to focus on ordinary objects and everyday life, a focus reflected in their use small, everyday words. They believed in treating the poem as an object presenting the poet's sincere attempt to look clearly at the world. Objectivist poems ranged in length anywhere from a few lines to, in the case of Louis Zukofky's ""A,"" eight hundred pages. Prominant Objectivist poets were Louis Zukofsky, George Oppen, Charles Reznikoff, and Carl Rakosi. The Objectivist school of poetry is in no way related to the pop philosophy of Ayn Rand."

Keep in mind that oboe players carry around knives to make reeds, so they already have the upper hand. It is commonly mistaken for a clarinet.
