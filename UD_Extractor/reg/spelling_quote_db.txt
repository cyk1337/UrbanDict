Many people attack "pawned" as a misspelling of "pwned", but it has, in fact, become an acceptable spelling.

Hoax religion founded by science fiction author and fucktard as a tax shelter, using material from his published works of science fiction as articles of faith. It is also known in its alternate spelling as "Sollontology", as coined by TV talk show genius Gorgeous George. Scientology is not to be confused with crap. Adherents of Scientology are primarily Hollywood celebrities, lawyers, and women who want to penetrate Tom Cruise. Scientology drama is all too common, and most of it is extremely amusing. For instance, to advance in the faith to OT level III to learn the tale of Xenu, the galactic tyrant who stacked hundreds of billions of his frozen citizens on planes that looked like DC8's with rocket engines, and hauled them over to Earth to be thrown into volcanoes for at least 100 years before blowing them up with hydrogen bombs and brainwashing them with a "three-D, super colossal motion picture" for 36 days. The traumatised thetans subsequently clustered around human bodies, in effect acting as invisible spiritual parasites that can only be removed using advanced Scientology techniques. The cost of reaching OT III is only $360,000. Central to the belief is in alien past lives, such as being "decieved into a love affair with a robot decked out as a beautiful red-haired girl", being run over by a Martian bishop driving a steamroller, being transformed into an intergalactic walrus which perished after falling out of a flying saucer and being "a very happy being who strayed to the planet Nostra 23,064,000,000 years ago". All of this was on Wikipedia, so it is guaranteed the absolute truth. If you are completely and fully suckered in, you can join an elite sector of Scientologists, the Sea Org, which stands for "Sea Organization". This arm of the "Church" was dreamed up by Hubbard in the mid-60's because he was a) really drunk/doped out of his mind most of the time, and b) because he felt butthurt by the real U.S. Navy, who refused to give him ill-gotten glory and fame, so he made a toy navy of some real piece of shit ships. If you're a good enough and devout enough Scientologist, when you join the Sea Org, you must sign a contract that binds you to the Scientology religion, the Sea Org and L. Ron Hubbard for a billion years, pledging to "come back" in all your reincarnations to serve him for that time. In exchange you get some really nifty things... You get about $16 a week in pay, your personal I.D. taken from you and locked away so you can't jump ship, you get to do demeaning and degrading physical labour and give the Church tacit permission to put you in the "RPF" (Rehabilitation Project Force) which is a punishment gulag that will make you beg, whine and plead like a little bitch for that degrading regular labour back. You may even find yourself locked in a ship's chain locker if at sea, or in the basement of the Ft. Harrison Hotel with all that healthy asbestos. The RPF makes Gitmo Bay look like Club Med. In an interesting side note, while the crew of the Sea Org were sweating and toiling at sea on the Apollo, Hubbard's Sea Org flagship, Hubbard himself surrounded himself with nubile, blonde 13 year old girls in hot pants and halter tops that he dubbed the "Commodore's Messenger Organization" or "CMO". He did this because running Scientology is serious fucking business. Sadly for him, he was also impotent. Most agree that it is batshit insane, and Battlefield Earth was as good a movie as getting jackhammered in the urethra for 3 hours. Scientology is, however, a very important part of society; it is one of the main sources in the Western world for the lulz.

Another way of spelling "window". It must be ok, because if you google "windwow" you come up with thousands and thousands of hits - even linked to companies who manufacture and sell windows. This word originated back in the early '70s when my sister typed up a Christmas poem parody I wrote called "Christmas in the '70s" as a parody of "T'was the Night Before Christmas". Anyway, the last lines in the poem went like this: He staggared to his sleigh and his team made a fixture, And away they all flew, like a horror picture. But I heard him exclaim, from his sleigh window sill, "I'll sue you if you don't pay the bill!" But she made a typo when she typed "window"... she actually typed "windwow". In fact that was the only mistake she made in typing up the entire thing. This was like the fourth time she had typed it in because I complained about other typos in previous drafts. So when I complained about "windwow", she grabbed it and put a line through the second "w" and gave it back to me, and that's when I realized that she wasn't going to type it in a fifth time. I think it was at that very moment when I ceased in being a perfectionist. Anyway, since that fateful day, whenever I wrote the words "window" or "windows", I intentionally spelled it "windwow" or "windwows" instead. This is especially noteworthy since I now work as a columnist for a computer magazine and have to write things about Microsoft Windwows a lot. It drives my editor crazy.

A misspelling of "metal" (obviously only used on myspace and AIM since the pronunciation of the two are exactly the same) commonly used by scene kids or any member of several sub-genres of human being not usually associated with heavy music. Usualy followed by "br00tl" or, in person, a "metal claw," it is meant to describe a band as being heavy while, 9 times out of 10, it's not. Once a common term used by scenesters it is now more of a tongue-in-cheek expression used to make fun of someone who thinks it's still cool to say medl even though that person was probably saying it themself about a week previously. "Medl," "br00tl," and "the metal claw" usually irritate metal heads who actually take their music seriously and know what makes something heavy. However, any false "medl-heads" are usually ignored since they're not worth correcting.

A Wikkan, is a person who practices a neo-pagan nature based religion. Contextually there is no difference in a Wikkan verses a Wiccan, except that in spelling. Wica, as it was spelled (perhaps mis-spelled) by Gerald Gardner is a modern reconstruction of ancient traditions and acient faith practices, although fairly modern in its new form. The various spellings differ based on location, liguistic translations, culture and tradtion. It is more common in Western societies to adapt to the anglo-saxon spelling "Wiccan", wheras other more European socieites adopt "Wikkan." There is often debate about the origin of the precursors "wic" verses "wik", both of which have had various meanings in differet societial constructs, such as "to bend and to twist", from which we get "wicker" and "wicked" and "wise one" such as derived from the term "vicor" and the precursor "vic." Also, it is possible that the Hwice tribe has had influenced the linguistic term known as either Wicca or Wikka today. Both are correct, depending upon locality, tradition, and culture. Also there are other varient spellings of this faith, worldwide.

Gay motherfucking dickheads who think they are such hard cunts and seem to believe that they are top shit as far as Penrith and other suburban areas are concerned. They are also known as "eshays" or "lads". These people bum around shopping areas constantly as they have either a)got their dumb asses kicked out of school or b)left with no ambition of doing anything but trying to bum smokes off people out the front of Penrith Plaza. They can be distinguished through their complete and utter lack of intelligence and their "fully sick bro" tracksuits, normally Canterbury or Nautica. These people live their lives under the strange illusion that they are the coolest and most original thing to ever hit the universe despite the fact most of their trends are based on previous generations. They also do not realise that they are so unintelligent and ridiculous that they dropped out of school and will be living off centrelink for the rest of their lives. Someone should inform them that getting pissed in random areas and being a total junkie retard is not cool. Drugs dont make you "hard" or "cool". They make you weaker as far as I'm concerned. To put it simply, they listen to shit music, wear shit clothes, are pussies when it comes to fights (I would snap them) and have total and utter disrespect for everyone and everything as they are so intellectually challenged they are incapable of even spelling the word "respect" to begin with.

The new spelling of the word "Jew" as defined by the Rabbinical College of America. The pronunciation of "Jew," however, has not changed; the P is silent. PJew is closer to the spelling of Jew in Hebrew. The old spelling, Jew, caused confusion between Jews and non-Hebrew speakers around the world. The Modern Language Association (MLA) accepted the spelling change proposed by the Rabbinical College of America, so it is now incorrect to write "Jew" in an MLA-format paper. Schools across the country are amending their essay policy so that teachers can take off points if you write "Jew" in a paper. According to the International Rabbinical Association, similar changes to the spelling of Jew will be made to other languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, Greek and Japanese.

Highly versatile word used throughout Ireland (not just the north as has been asserted by some) ,meaning (shared and /or convival) fun, or excitement e.g."great crack at the disco last night!", also news "What's the crack?" It also has a subsidiary meaning of "Funny business". "Don't come that crack with me!" (Don't mess with me) Clearly related to "crack" in standard English, as in "wisecracks,""cracking jokes" etc.While proponents of "Ulster-Scots" (northern Hiberno-English) claim that it was assimilated into Irish and then Hiberno-English from Scots or Ulster-Scots the truth is more complex. The (Gaelic) Irish lexicographer Dineen lists the term "cracaire" (basically an asshole!) neary a century ago while Newnes New Comprehensive Dictionary of the English Languge (circa 1920)ascribes Dutch, Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic antecedents to the word "crack" when used in the sense of fun or chat - but not in Scots (language) except in the sense of "an instant" e.g. "the crack of dawn".

Originating from ancient Israel and the Hebrew language, Jesse when directly translated means "God Is", as a statement of God's eternal nature and glory; past, present and future. Bears a similar statement to God referring to Himself as "I Am" in the Bible. Later on, other meanings were attributed as being "Gift", "Wealth" and "Wealthy", but it's true meaning serves as the ultimate expression of God's infinite/eternal nature.Furthermore, as per Hebrew naming culture and language traditions, the name "Jesse" is an exclusively male name. There is only one proper spelling of "Jesse", and that is without the "i" in it. Many centuries later, the name "Jessica" was created as the female version, however, enough time passed and morons started naming their girls "Jessie" instead of "Jessica", or worse yet, just "Jesse"; thus the abomination was born. Jesse is not and has never been or will be a unisex name, it is 100% masculine going back thousands of years.The name Jesse is straight out of the Bible; the father of King David. It is a name that exuberates masculinity and godliness.There are two kinds of Jesse: the Christian Jesse and the godless Jesse, the alpha Jesse and the beta Jesse, the tall Jesse and (heaven forbid) the short Jesse, the true Jesse and the faux Jesse.If you should stumble across the true Jesse, a tall Christian alpha male, then marry him quick before he's gone forever.
