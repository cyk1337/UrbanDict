	ichihime, ichihime	6456237	Ichihime The most idiotic pairing in the show. This fandom is based solely on Orihime's unrequirited feelings towards ichigo.In fact half of the fans tend to base their arguments in the size of Orihime's breasts and the fact that she and Ichigo have orange hair, they also over react to any scene where Ichigo shows some kind of affection towards Orihime even if it's the same kind of affection he holds for his other friends like Ishida or Chad.Also lately the Ichihime fans have started with what I believe is the dumbest way of making their fave pairing look better, which is to Bash Ichiruki with an argument that it causes super-herpes which is only a lame way to say Ichihime is good (but it isn't) In the end even if Ichiruki does not become canon (because in the end bleach is a shonen) it will always be more possible to happen that Ichihime because Ichigo doesn't have romantic feelings towards Orihime nor has he hinted so, and despite the fact that he fights so much with Rukia he's said several times that she changed his world and is shown to be more desperate and concerned about her than he is about other characters whenever she's hurt or in danger. Orihime doesn't love him completelyHalf the people who like Ichihime are crybabies who don't really seem to be able to handle the truth and go on and on about how Ichiruki shippers or people with common sense badmouth them.
