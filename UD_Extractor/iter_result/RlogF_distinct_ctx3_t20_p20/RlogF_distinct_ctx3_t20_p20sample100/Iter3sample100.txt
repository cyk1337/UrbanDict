Boston sucks at making pizza, freckle-faced ginger massholes. -Lot's of bids here are pretty. -West Conn people say MAD, East Conn fag boston wannabes say WICKED every chance they get. -It's not called a fucking Packy, it's either a bodega or a liquor store. -Hartford and Springfield are NOT twin cities. Hartford wants nothing to do with the even shittier, more pathetic Springfield, Mass. -Many people take advantage of the proximity to NYC and shop, go to ball games, see shows, and eat at the best restaurants in the world. -No one goes to Boston unless they want to get drunk and beat up black people with Irish, freckle-faced, ugly, pimply, masshole, ginger red sux fans. -Everyone ought to hate the Gaytriots, especially after they teased Hartford then retracted their plans to move there, because Hartford was not New England enough. -People tend to like New Jersey better than Massachusetts.

Nobody in West Conn cares about Boston. -Central Connecticut gets overrun on weekends by New Yorkers, New Jersyans, Rhode Islanders, and Massholes who like to shop here and not at their own fucking stores. -An enormous wall should be built to keep the Massholes out, that, or $50 tolls to get in from Massachusetts.
