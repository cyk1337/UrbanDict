There are many types of I/Sers. Some I/Sers go on everyday all day. Some of them go on once a week, once a month, a couple of times a year but they always go on I/S for a revisit most of the time and not some other LAME neoboard. I/Ser is basically someone who MOSTLY goes on I/S and they don't always have to be well-known there but they usually are for some reason.

I am just simply reinstating the truth behind the whole thing.
