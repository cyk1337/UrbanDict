	amazoness, amazonesu	216292  A word made up from bad Japanese translations of the word \"Amazonesu.\" It's a combination of the word Amazon which refers to female warriors. And the suffix -ess which indicates female. So Amazoness is like saying \"female Amazon\" which means \"female female warrior.\" I'm not quite sure why the Japanese use the word Amazonesu sometimes and Amazon other times. Unless it has something to do with Japanese not having plural words so they feel free to switch between the plural and singular. I believe Amazones is the plural of Amazon in Greek, but I'm not sure. It would probably be best to translate Amazonesu as Amazon or Amazons.

Surprisingly, these same turkeys were known to suffer mental retardation and would frequently get themselves killed at young ages by engaging in such activities as drowning themselves in puddles of water or by repeatedly slamming their heads into the ground. And more shocking and rare in the animal kingdom, these same turkeys frequently attempted homosexual activities with other turkeys. When these turkeys were slaughtered and cooked for human consumption, it was noticed that their meat was exceptionally bitter in taste and grainy in texture, thus making them very undesirable in the poultry industry.These turkeys were called \"Hokies\".From the history of the word and understanding the Virgina Tech student population, it should be clear why the school adopted the Hokie as its mascot.

Maybe in a case of Irish humor, the song got its name as a parody of all the songs that feature the word \"motherfucker\" that saturated the market at the time, going on today.
