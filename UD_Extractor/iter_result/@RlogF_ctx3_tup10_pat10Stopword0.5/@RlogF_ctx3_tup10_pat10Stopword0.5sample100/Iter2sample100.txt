	intel, innovation	1139792	A micro-processor (and other hardware components) manufacturer that needs to taught the meaning of the word innovation. In this respect, rival AMD is no better, having produced absolutely nothing original since its creation.

Now that clock-speed mania has finally subsided, both companies are rushing to finalise production of affordable 1st-generation dual-core PCs. A sensible prediction would be that the Intel Smithfield core will be obscenely expensive but will most definitely outperform AMD's dual-core answer (and yes, I do realise that current stats show otherwise). To top off with the proverbial icing on the cake, both companies capitalise on enthusiast hype to market their bloody awful technology which has been sucking shit through a straw for the past 10 years (much longer for Intel). Neither of these two giants have the foresight to invest in something more feasible for the 21st century; more specifically, quantum processing. The companies have tremendous fan-following (most of the fans being utterly fucked in the head) despite their childish one-upmanship which has been going on for seemingly an eternity.
