The United States is still a young nation and therefore still exhibits the ignorance that older countries have already learned from.When you think of the word \"American\" try to remember that while most Americans exploit the word \"freedom\" many of them acknowledge the word \"accountability\".Fellow Americans: We can change these problems.

	humpadump, are	6379230  The word is a universal applicable word. This means that the word can be used to replace any other word or phrase. To understand the actually meaning one must know the context of usage.Background: although the origins of the word are unknown, it is rumored to have come from the coolest college student ever. By analyzing the word structure one can create a theory of how the word was created. Broken down, \"hump\" means: thrusting one's pelvis into an object usually a butt of a person, pulling back, and then as the saying goes \"rinse and repeat\". \"a\" is an article that refers to a single item. \"dump\" is a slang word for fecal matter. Separately the words have nothing to do with each other, but as a whole the word creates a meaning. This resembles the nature of how humpadump is used, without context the word is meaningless. This lead to the conclusion that the word's inventor might have been in a I'm-speechless moment\", a I-don't-know-what-to-say moment, or any other indescribable situation and had the idea to create a word that fills the awkward time.For more information, visit www.natnlhumpadumpday.com

	conversate, conversate	3608787  Conversate = for many having a conversation. However the correct term according to the so called grammatically correct is to \"converse.\" Someone wrote an unecessary and rude explanation stereotyping inner city individuals for use of the word conversate. In their defense I would like to note the following: Personally I'm caucasian and not from the inner city. I went to Princeton. Many of my colleagues, ( also not from the inner city) used the word conversate. However converse is the proper phrase which actually reminds me of the sneakers converse. Conversate should be added to regular to end all bias. It's easy to determinewhere the word is derived from and what is mean when a person uses the term. At the end of the day a word is just a word because someone made it to mean one thing based on interpretation. New words are formed everyday which should have no reference to slang unless they have no real structure of evident meaning. Spread peace. :-)
