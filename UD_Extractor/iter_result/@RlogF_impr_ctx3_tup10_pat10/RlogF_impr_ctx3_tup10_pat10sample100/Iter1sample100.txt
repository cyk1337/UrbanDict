	toon, character	5529111	A toon is a synonym for a character in a video game that is a role-playing game, usually used only in the context of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Games (MMORPG), such as World of Warcraft.Character, avatar, or toon are synonyms in this context. (Avatar is a misnomer, however.)In role-playing games, a great deal of effort is spent in creating a unique persona or character before play begins. During character generation, the player makes choices that will affect the gameplay, such as appearance, name, gender, race, and class. Once created, these characteristics are immutable, as they define the play experience. The selection of class determines the strategies the character will use to succeed.In short, Role-playing games have great replay value because a player can re-experience the game using a new character or toon.ETYMOLOGYToon is presumably a contracted form of cartoon; video game characters are animated, after all. The origin of this term can be attributed to the standard root of all leetspeak (internet jargon): a need for efficiency for lazy typists.Toon is probably used because it is shorter and easier to type than the word character. Anyone familiar with these games can easily surmise the meaning of the term from context. Furthermore, the term avatar is avoided as it can possibly create confusion. In roleplaying games, avatar also refers to the incarnation of a deity.

	pooned, the	1652313	A variation on the word \"pwned\", but DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME MEANING! Also COMMONLY MISTAKEN AS the word \"pwned\". Pooned is derived from the two words \"pwned\" (which is synonymous to \"owned\"; started in the online gaming community) and \"poon\" (which is a modern-day slang term for a woman's vagina). Pooned can have a number of different meanings. The most obvious definition would be derived from combining the meanings of the two source words together - hence meaning, to be beaten or owned by a girl or a woman. The word is also less commonly used to refer to a male who is \"pussy whipped\". A common application would be during Internet gaming, when a player announces herself to be female (upon which about 50% of the other male players in the server will commence to hit on her), and then commences to beat a male opponent. Everyone else in the same game server will then commence to type out \"pooned!\" (rather than \"pwned\") in an effort to ridicule the unfortunate player. Other common applications would include sports. Something interesting to note is the fequencey in which this word is mistaken for the word \"pwned\", especially in spoken language. Such a mistake could lead to very long awkward silences in group conversations (especially when there are women around) because of the word's phonetic similarity to the word \"poon\". Such a situation usually ends with the idiot being slapped by one of the more prominent females of the group, or just generally being laughed at and ridiculed by the whole group. It is also amusing to watch the uneducated (usually prepubescent boys around the age of 13 who are obssesively addicted to Internet gaming) running abound shouting the word \"pooned\" at each other when what they mean to say is \"pwned\". A final note on misusage, the source word \"pwned\" is simply \"pwned\" (pronounced p-owned). Not \"pooned\", not \"pweened\", not \"pwooned\", or anything else some idiot could possibly come up with, just \"pwned\". The history of the word \"pwned\" began when people would try to type out the word \"owned\" really fast, but would hit the \"p\" key instead of the \"o\" key on accident. \"pwned\" took on more popularity than \"owned\" after that. It is not some fancy word that some genius geek-elite out there invented, it simply began with the word \"owned\" and should thus be pronounced like the word \"owned\". Fin.
