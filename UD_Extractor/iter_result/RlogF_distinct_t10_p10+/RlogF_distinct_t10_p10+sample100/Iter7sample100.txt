	goick, are	5788828  A word usually used as a transitive verb has found itself as an unlikely vanguard of London vernacular. Although the derivations of the word are private the implications are paradoxically large. The verb was coined on Highbury Fields during a game of b.u.m.s. a favourite football game of the locals. Because the bum is the focal point of this game other acronyms were yearned for. Due to the exceptional form of a certain bum the phrase 'goick' was formed, the reasons, as said, private. The word quickly changed meaning as sexual implications ran quickly into its usage, fittingly, considering its derivation. It morphed to such an extent to be mainly used as an acronym for the transitive verb associated with anal sex. However, the original meaning remains intact in b.u.m.s. vernacular, the 'goicking' is when the losing player is struck on his arse (goick) by the ball by the winning players.
