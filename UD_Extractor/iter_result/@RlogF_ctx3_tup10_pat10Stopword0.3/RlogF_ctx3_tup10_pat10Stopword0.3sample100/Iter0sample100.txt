A sweaty is someone who listens to heavy metal or any other kind of metal (except nu metal) this includes death metal. They wear REALLY WIDE SHOES that fall off if they run and look really dumb. They also wear jeans (or skater trousers) too long for them that go over their shoes and then some (sometimes rolled up in summer or to expose their shoes). They have chains attached to their jeans (for some reason) and a belt that hangs down with metal studs on them. They wear hoodies or really big shirts that hang all the way down to their knees almost and pass their hands like their jeans do with their feet (sometimes rolled up aswell)! They have wrist bands with spikes or bones on them and a dog collar. Their shirt/hoodie MUST have a name of a band on it or their a sweaty wannabe. They have long hair like a mop head that is either curly, or twice as long at the back. They have iPods glued to their ears playing really loud and annoying music, (heavy metal). They sometimes wear a cap, or have a skateboard but that's to 'look cool', they can't skate. The confusion of the word sweaty started when the words goth, emo, skater and indie came around in the 80's and 90's so the chav (townie) term for sweaty is anyone who likes rock music or has long hair.
