119:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

222:88 robin @starvelingbot , the tailor . #amndbots

324:114 if we meet in the city , we shall be dogg'd with company , and our #amndbots

529:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

222:156 come from the farthest steep of india , but that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , #amndbots

222:163 met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , by paved fountain , or by rushy brook , or on the beached margent of the sea , #amndbots

15:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

222:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

428:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

120:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

428:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

120:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

428:780 pyramus draws near the wall ; silence . #amndbots

325:901 first , rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note ; hand in hand , with fairy grace , #amndbots

120:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

429:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

429:93 the joiner , you , the lion's part : -- and , i hope , here is a play fitted . #amndbots

429:110 some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . -- but , masters , here are your #amndbots

121:105 day ; a most lovely gentleman-like man ; therefore you must needs play pyramus . #amndbots

121:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

225:248 to make my small elves coats ; and some keep back the clamorous owl , that nightly hoots and wonders #amndbots

533:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

533:86 no , no , you must play pyramus ; and , @fluteshakebot , you thisby . #amndbots

19:42 and she is mine ; and all my right of her i do estate unto @demetriusbot . #amndbots

327:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

19:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

19:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

533:595 how came these things to pass ? o , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now ! #amndbots

533:617 such gallant chiding ; for , besides the groves , the skies , the fountains , every region near #amndbots

122:840 well roared , lion . #amndbots

430:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

431:40 relent , sweet @hermiabot ; -- and , @lysanderbot , yield thy crazed title to my certain right . #amndbots

431:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

328:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

431:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

431:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

124:574 sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms . fairies , be gone , and be all ways away . #amndbots

535:442 an if i could , what should i get therefore ? #amndbots

227:651 these things seem small and undistinguishable , like far-off mountains turned into clouds . #amndbots

124:705 one sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; that is the madman : the lover , all as frantic , #amndbots

21:481 take not her part ; for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her , thou shalt aby it . #amndbots

227:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

125:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

228:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

433:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

433:829 he dares not come there for the candle : for , you see , it is already in snuff . #amndbots

228:842 well shone , moon . -- truly , the moon shines with a good grace . #amndbots

228:860 no die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one . #amndbots

536:674 it is not possible : you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he . #amndbots

330:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

125:879 no epilogue , i pray you ; for your play needs no excuse . never excuse ; for when the players are all dead there #amndbots

229:3 another moon ; but , oh , methinks , how slow this old moon wanes ! she lingers my desires , #amndbots

434:5 four days will quickly steep themselves in nights ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; #amndbots

331:23 to stubborn harshness . -- and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace #amndbots

331:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

331:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

331:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

229:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

23:145 sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me ; then slip i from her bum , down topples she , #amndbots

331:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

435:598 music , ho ! music ; such as charmeth sleep . #amndbots

332:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

538:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

538:545 when thou wak'st , thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye : and the country proverb known , #amndbots

435:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

435:807 no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning . #amndbots

538:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

333:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

436:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

437:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

232:186 would imitate ; and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise . #amndbots

334:218 the one i'll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood , #amndbots

129:224 to trust the opportunity of night , and the ill counsel of a desert place , with the rich worth of your virginity . #amndbots

540:110 some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . -- but , masters , here are your #amndbots

232:295 well , we will have such a prologue ; and it shall be written in eight and six . #amndbots

26:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

232:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

232:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

334:755 his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . who is next ? #amndbots

129:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

334:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

438:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

336:41 scornful @lysanderbot ! true , he hath my love ; and what is mine my love shall render him ; #amndbots

439:60 here is the scroll of every man's name , which is thought fit , through all athens , to play in our interlude before the #amndbots

234:77 francis @fluteshakebot , the bellows-mender . #amndbots

131:188 and for her sake i will not part with him . #amndbots

28:34 chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon . thrice-blessed they that master so their blood #amndbots

28:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

439:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

234:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

439:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

336:737 the kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing . our sport shall be to take what they mistake : #amndbots

440:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

441:113 mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse : for #amndbots

236:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

543:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

29:830 i am aweary of this moon : would he would change ! #amndbots

236:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

544:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

133:165 therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea #amndbots

338:191 and see our moonlight revels , go with us ; if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts . #amndbots

29:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

441:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

237:880 need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played #amndbots

134:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

443:5 four days will quickly steep themselves in nights ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; #amndbots

545:772 no wonder , my lord : one lion may , when many asses do . #amndbots

340:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

546:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

443:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

238:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

443:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

136:424 he murder cries , and help from athens calls . their sense thus weak , lost with their fears , thus strong , #amndbots

444:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

33:536 by day's approach look to be visited . #amndbots

444:830 i am aweary of this moon : would he would change ! #amndbots

33:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

33:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

445:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

445:23 to stubborn harshness . -- and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace #amndbots

34:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

343:417 that work for bread upon athenian stalls , were met together to rehearse a play #amndbots

446:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

343:462 then will two at once woo one , -- that must needs be sport alone ; and those things do best please me #amndbots

549:445 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe ; #amndbots

138:625 this @helenashakebot , old nedar's @helenashakebot : i wonder of their being here together . #amndbots

343:653 why , then , we are awake : let's follow him ; and by the way let us recount our dreams . #amndbots

343:703 lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend #amndbots

446:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

138:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

138:712 more witnesseth than fancy's images , and grows to something of great constancy ; but , howsoever , strange and admirable . #amndbots

138:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

36:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

139:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

448:145 sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me ; then slip i from her bum , down topples she , #amndbots

550:914 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

140:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

37:175 an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is , as in mockery , set : the spring , the summer , #amndbots

37:181 set your heart at rest ; the fairy-land buys not the child of me . his mother was a vot'ress of my order : #amndbots

140:532 and dar'st not stand , nor look me in the face . where art thou ? #amndbots

345:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

345:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

448:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

552:641 melted as the snow -- seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gawd which in my childhood i did dote upon : #amndbots

552:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

142:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

347:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

245:677 you must say paragon : a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught . #amndbots

450:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

142:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

142:729 what are they that do play it ? #amndbots

553:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

554:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

451:474 if she cannot entreat , i can compel . #amndbots

143:477 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

246:535 now , go thy way . faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed . -- #amndbots

348:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

554:387 the honey bags steal from the humble-bees , and , for nigh t-t apers , crop their waxen thighs , #amndbots

143:625 this @helenashakebot , old nedar's @helenashakebot : i wonder of their being here together . #amndbots

451:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

143:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

349:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

144:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

144:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

144:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

349:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

452:727 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

555:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

349:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

248:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

350:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

453:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

42:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

350:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

145:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

454:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

454:724 when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ' the thrice three muses mourning for the death #amndbots

351:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

454:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

351:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

146:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

558:98 an you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were #amndbots

455:282 pat , pat ; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal . this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn #amndbots

44:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

147:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

455:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

456:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

353:645 now i do wish it , love it , long for it , and will for evermore be true to it . #amndbots

354:105 day ; a most lovely gentleman-like man ; therefore you must needs play pyramus . #amndbots

252:157 your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love , to @theseusshakebot must be wedded ; and you come #amndbots

354:172 no night is now with hymn or carol blest : -- therefore the moon , the governess of floods , #amndbots

149:166 contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , hath every pelting river made so proud #amndbots

252:186 would imitate ; and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise . #amndbots

149:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

457:385 be kind and courteous to this gentleman ; hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes ; #amndbots

150:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

253:808 this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard . #amndbots

355:829 he dares not come there for the candle : for , you see , it is already in snuff . #amndbots

47:635 enough , enough , my lord ; you have enough ; i beg the law , the law upon his head . -- #amndbots

459:58 is all our company here ? #amndbots

356:79 @fluteshakebot , you must take thisby on you . #amndbots

561:892 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

459:141 thou speak'st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to @oberonbot , and make him smile , #amndbots

254:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

459:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

562:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

357:731 i will hear that play ; for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it . #amndbots

563:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

255:845 and so comes pyramus . #amndbots

152:915 so , good night unto you all . give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends . #amndbots

153:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

153:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

256:358 bless thee , @bottomshakebot ! bless thee ! thou art translated . #amndbots

50:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

462:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

51:193 not for thy fairy kingdom . fairies , away : we shall chide downright if i longer stay . #amndbots

154:440 you spend your passion on a mispris'd mood : i am not guilty of @lysanderbot's blood ; #amndbots

462:531 abide me , if thou dar'st; for well i wot thou runn'st before me , shifting every place ; #amndbots

51:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

154:534 nay , then , thou mock'st me . thou shalt buy this dear , if ever i thy face by daylight see : #amndbots

154:566 what , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ? #amndbots

359:598 music , ho ! music ; such as charmeth sleep . #amndbots

359:676 yea , and the best person too : and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice . #amndbots

462:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

359:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

565:545 when thou wak'st , thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye : and the country proverb known , #amndbots

462:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

257:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

462:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

565:891 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

53:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

156:389 and pluck the wings from painted butterflies , to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes : #amndbots

361:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

53:222 tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit ; for i am sick when i do look on thee . #amndbots

259:480 you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services . let her alone : speak not of @helenashakebot ; #amndbots

567:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

259:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

156:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

464:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

464:677 you must say paragon : a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught . #amndbots

54:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

466:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

363:325 when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake ; and so every one according to his cue . #amndbots

466:368 i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note . so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; #amndbots

466:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

365:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

468:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

263:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

571:182 and , in the spiced indian air , by night , full often hath she gossip'd by my side ; #amndbots

263:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

571:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

263:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

365:730 and we will hear it . #amndbots

160:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

365:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

263:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

58:652 it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream . -- do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ? #amndbots

161:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

162:23 to stubborn harshness . -- and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace #amndbots

573:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

265:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

265:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

162:740 make periods in the midst of sentences , throttle their practis'd accent in their fears , #amndbots

163:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

369:70 a lover , that kills himself most gallantly for love . #amndbots

267:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

267:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

267:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

164:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

267:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

472:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

164:648 and , for the morning now is something worn , our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside . -- #amndbots

472:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

267:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

472:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

267:806 now is the mural down between the two neighbours . #amndbots

62:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

576:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

165:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

62:474 if she cannot entreat , i can compel . #amndbots

576:618 seem'd all one mutual cry : i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder . #amndbots

62:574 sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms . fairies , be gone , and be all ways away . #amndbots

370:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

474:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

474:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

577:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

269:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

269:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

371:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

577:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

167:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

475:112 con them by to-morrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a #amndbots

577:902 will we sing , and bless this place . #amndbots

475:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

475:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

475:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

476:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

373:613 despatch , i say , and find the forester . -- #amndbots

271:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

476:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

271:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

476:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

476:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

373:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

579:639 and i in fury hither follow'd them , fair @helenashakebot in fancy following me . #amndbots

476:821 not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose . #amndbots

373:866 a mote will turn the balance , which pyramus , which thisbe , is the better . #amndbots

272:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

579:853 beshrew my heart , but i pity the man . #amndbots

477:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

272:513 here comes one . #amndbots

374:515 here , villain ; drawn and ready . where art thou ? #amndbots

477:540 yet but three ? come one more ; two of both kinds makes up four . here she comes , curst and sad : -- cupid is a knavish lad , #amndbots

272:546 that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown : jack shall have jill ; nought shall go ill ; #amndbots

170:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

273:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

67:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

478:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

273:653 why , then , we are awake : let's follow him ; and by the way let us recount our dreams . #amndbots

375:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

375:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

581:637 you of your wife , and me of my consent , -- of my consent that she should be your wife . #amndbots

581:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

582:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

274:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

479:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

172:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

583:442 an if i could , what should i get therefore ? #amndbots

275:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

275:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

172:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

378:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

173:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

481:462 then will two at once woo one , -- that must needs be sport alone ; and those things do best please me #amndbots

584:811 if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men . #amndbots

277:78 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

483:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

278:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

278:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

175:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

278:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

380:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

278:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

483:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

483:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

380:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

586:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

73:540 yet but three ? come one more ; two of both kinds makes up four . here she comes , curst and sad : -- cupid is a knavish lad , #amndbots

176:897 to sweep the dust behind the door . #amndbots

382:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

485:616 i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear with hounds of sparta : never did i hear #amndbots

485:753 this fellow doth not stand upon points . #amndbots

485:828 this is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ' the moon ? #amndbots

75:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

383:914 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

487:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

384:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

487:342 ninus ' tomb , man : why , you must not speak that yet : that you answer to pyramus . you speak all your part at once , #amndbots

76:220 hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more . #amndbots

179:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

179:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

282:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

179:746 let him approach . #amndbots

77:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

180:463 that befall preposterously . #amndbots

283:604 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

488:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

592:95 you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring . #amndbots

489:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

489:317 ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a #amndbots

181:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

386:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

386:737 the kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing . our sport shall be to take what they mistake : #amndbots

592:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

387:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

185:22 with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart ; turned her obedience , which is due to me , #amndbots

493:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

493:111 parts : and i am to entreat you , request you , and desire you , to #amndbots

82:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

390:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

390:648 and , for the morning now is something worn , our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside . -- #amndbots

390:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

596:891 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

83:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

83:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

494:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

186:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

83:472 look where thy love comes ; yonder is thy dear . #amndbots

83:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

83:608 with these mortals on the ground . #amndbots

494:832 stay the time . #amndbots

494:880 need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played #amndbots

187:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

392:646 fair lovers , you are fortunately met : of this discourse we more will hear anon . -- @egeusbot , i will overbear your will ; #amndbots

495:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

496:420 an ass's nowl i fixèd on his head ; anon , his thisbe must be answered , #amndbots

188:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

291:624 my lord , this is my daughter here asleep ; and this @lysanderbot ; this @demetriusbot is ; #amndbots

87:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

601:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

293:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

293:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

499:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

88:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

603:531 abide me , if thou dar'st; for well i wot thou runn'st before me , shifting every place ; #amndbots

398:513 here comes one . #amndbots

193:516 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

197:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

505:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

300:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

505:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

608:671 have you sent to @bottomshakebot's house ? is he come home yet ? #amndbots

198:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

404:476 quick , come , -- #amndbots

199:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

610:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

303:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

304:343 cues , and all . -- pyramus enter : your cue is past ; it is ' never tire . ' #amndbots

612:221 do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ? or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i cannot love you ? #amndbots

201:388 and light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes , to have my love to bed and to arise ; #amndbots

612:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

98:221 do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ? or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i cannot love you ? #amndbots

614:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

99:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

614:95 you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring . #amndbots

306:317 ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a #amndbots

511:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

614:646 fair lovers , you are fortunately met : of this discourse we more will hear anon . -- @egeusbot , i will overbear your will ; #amndbots

512:892 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

205:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

410:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

513:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

410:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

410:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

205:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

616:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

616:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

206:34 chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon . thrice-blessed they that master so their blood #amndbots

103:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

206:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

206:506 they wilfully exile themselves from light , and must for aye consort with black-brow'd night . #amndbots

412:15 full of vexation come i , with complaint against my child , my daughter @hermiabot . -- #amndbots

207:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

104:619 my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung #amndbots

515:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

207:886 i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch'd . #amndbots

104:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

105:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

516:674 it is not possible : you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he . #amndbots

311:821 not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose . #amndbots

105:628 it is , my lord . #amndbots

311:860 no die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one . #amndbots

312:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

517:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

517:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

518:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

107:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

107:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

210:550 come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , while i thy amiable cheeks do coy , #amndbots

210:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

416:712 more witnesseth than fancy's images , and grows to something of great constancy ; but , howsoever , strange and admirable . #amndbots

211:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

315:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

315:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

108:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

315:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

315:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

5:845 and so comes pyramus . #amndbots

315:389 and pluck the wings from painted butterflies , to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes : #amndbots

109:174 the seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; and on old hyem's thin and icy crown #amndbots

623:295 well , we will have such a prologue ; and it shall be written in eight and six . #amndbots

212:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

110:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

214:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

419:319 of moonshine . then there is another thing : we must have a wall in the great chamber ; for pyramus and thisby , says the #amndbots

419:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

419:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

626:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

318:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

420:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

9:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

9:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

523:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

319:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

112:835 why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . #amndbots

524:176 the childing autumn , angry winter , change their wonted liveries ; and the maz'd world , #amndbots

421:184 when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive , and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind ; #amndbots

421:187 but she , being mortal , of that boy did die ; and for her sake do i rear up her boy : #amndbots

627:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

114:2 now , fair @hippolytabot , our nuptial hour draws on apace ; four happy days bring in #amndbots

10:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

422:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

320:435 this is the woman , but not this the man . #amndbots

422:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

11:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

320:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

11:450 then fate o'er-rules , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath . #amndbots

321:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

423:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

526:77 francis @fluteshakebot , the bellows-mender . #amndbots

322:46 for you , fair @hermiabot , look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will , #amndbots

630:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

116:82 nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; i have a beard coming . #amndbots

12:881 pyramus , and hang'd himself in thisbe's garter , it would have #amndbots

527:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

527:810 it must be your imagination then , and not theirs . #amndbots

630:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

527:862 how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ? #amndbots

425:822 his discretion , i am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . it is well ; leave it to his #amndbots

631:716 between our after-supper and bed-time ? where is our usual manager of mirth ? what revels are in hand ? is there no play #amndbots

425:886 i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch'd . #amndbots

529:14 thanks , good @egeusbot : what's the news with thee ? #amndbots

117:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

324:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

324:32 know of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father's choice , #amndbots

221:488 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

324:628 it is , my lord . #amndbots

118:428 @titaniabot wak'd , and straightway lov'd an ass . #amndbots

325:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

427:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

119:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

120:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

223:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

428:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

17:13 happy be @theseusshakebot , our renowned duke ! #amndbots

120:226 i will not stay thy questions ; let me go : or , if thou follow me , do not believe #amndbots

223:472 look where thy love comes ; yonder is thy dear . #amndbots

120:317 ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a #amndbots

223:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

531:595 how came these things to pass ? o , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now ! #amndbots

121:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

429:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

429:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

532:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

224:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

224:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

327:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

327:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

430:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

430:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

225:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

430:282 pat , pat ; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal . this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn #amndbots

18:830 i am aweary of this moon : would he would change ! #amndbots

328:375 out of this wood do not desire to go ; thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . #amndbots

430:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

534:70 a lover , that kills himself most gallantly for love . #amndbots

329:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

123:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

534:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

329:755 his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . who is next ? #amndbots

432:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

331:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

228:620 with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like thessalian bulls ; #amndbots

536:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

228:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

433:738 and what poor duty cannot do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed #amndbots

228:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

331:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

229:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

332:110 some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . -- but , masters , here are your #amndbots

332:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

229:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

229:217 i love thee not , therefore pursue me not . where is @lysanderbot and fair @hermiabot ? #amndbots

537:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

434:247 some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds ; some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings , #amndbots

434:373 thou art as wise as thou art beautiful . #amndbots

229:439 i had rather give his carcass to my hounds . #amndbots

126:246 come , now a roundel and a fairy song ; then , for the third part of a minute , hence ; #amndbots

434:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

434:724 when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ' the thrice three muses mourning for the death #amndbots

332:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

435:546 that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown : jack shall have jill ; nought shall go ill ; #amndbots

538:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

231:217 i love thee not , therefore pursue me not . where is @lysanderbot and fair @hermiabot ? #amndbots

539:368 i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note . so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; #amndbots

128:174 the seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; and on old hyem's thin and icy crown #amndbots

25:11 with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . #amndbots

334:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

231:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

334:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

539:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

539:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

25:593 my @oberonbot ! what visions have i seen ! methought i was enamour'd of an ass . #amndbots

540:112 con them by to-morrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a #amndbots

437:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

335:268 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

232:604 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

129:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

232:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

129:515 here , villain ; drawn and ready . where art thou ? #amndbots

335:895 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

335:915 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

438:842 well shone , moon . -- truly , the moon shines with a good grace . #amndbots

337:29 in himself he is : but , in this kind , wanting your father's voice , the other must be held the worthier . #amndbots

337:60 here is the scroll of every man's name , which is thought fit , through all athens , to play in our interlude before the #amndbots

542:107 why , what you will . #amndbots

130:828 this is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ' the moon ? #amndbots

439:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

543:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

543:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

440:771 i wonder if the lion be to speak . #amndbots

29:364 * waking . * what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ? #amndbots

339:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

544:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

441:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

30:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

30:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

441:599 now when thou wak'st , with thine own fool's eyes peep . #amndbots

442:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

31:310 well , it shall be so . but there is two hard things ; that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber : for , you know , #amndbots

545:820 true ; and a goose for his discretion . #amndbots

341:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

239:438 yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere . #amndbots

33:90 robin @starvelingbot , you must play thisby's mother . -- tom @snoutshakebot , the tinker . #amndbots

547:535 now , go thy way . faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed . -- #amndbots

342:593 my @oberonbot ! what visions have i seen ! methought i was enamour'd of an ass . #amndbots

547:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

547:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

444:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

239:723 tearing the thracian singer in their rage . ' that is an old device , and it was play'd #amndbots

547:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

548:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

343:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

343:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

548:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

33:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

343:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

241:338 ay , marry , must you : for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again . #amndbots

446:441 nor is he dead , for aught that i can tell . #amndbots

35:13 happy be @theseusshakebot , our renowned duke ! #amndbots

35:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

35:45 and come , @egeusbot ; you shall go with me ; i have some private schooling for you both . -- #amndbots

344:620 with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like thessalian bulls ; #amndbots

138:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

550:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

242:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

345:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

345:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

550:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

36:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

243:156 come from the farthest steep of india , but that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , #amndbots

448:169 the fold stands empty in the drowned field , and crows are fatted with the murrion flock ; #amndbots

243:185 which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following , -- her womb then rich with my young squire , -- #amndbots

140:80 what is thisby ? a wandering knight ? #amndbots

448:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

37:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

346:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

37:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

140:896 now are frolic ; not a mouse shall disturb this hallow'd house : i am sent with broom before , #amndbots

244:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

449:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

347:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

245:44 but , being over-full of self-affairs , my mind did lose it . -- but , @demetriusbot , come ; #amndbots

245:48 to death , or to a vow of single life . -- come , my @hippolytabot : what cheer , my love ? #amndbots

142:7 go , @philostratebot , stir up the athenian youth to merriments ; awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth ; #amndbots

38:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

142:31 either to die the death , or to abjure for ever the society of men . therefore , fair @hermiabot , question your desires , #amndbots

142:38 for everlasting bond of fellowship , -- upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father's will ; #amndbots

38:861 with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass . #amndbots

39:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

245:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

142:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

245:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

450:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

451:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

349:268 this flower's force in stirring love . night and silence ! who is here ? weeds of athens he doth wear : #amndbots

451:772 no wonder , my lord : one lion may , when many asses do . #amndbots

451:823 discretion , and let us listen to the moon . #amndbots

143:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

451:863 she will find him by starlight . -- here she comes ; and her passion ends the play . #amndbots

451:881 pyramus , and hang'd himself in thisbe's garter , it would have #amndbots

246:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

143:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

247:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

452:44 but , being over-full of self-affairs , my mind did lose it . -- but , @demetriusbot , come ; #amndbots

143:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

40:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

555:488 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

555:504 troop home to churchyards : damned spirits all , that in cross-ways and floods have burial , #amndbots

351:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

556:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

248:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

248:754 indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder ; a sound , but not in government . #amndbots

556:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

453:879 no epilogue , i pray you ; for your play needs no excuse . never excuse ; for when the players are all dead there #amndbots

455:445 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe ; #amndbots

353:478 i would i had your bond ; for i perceive a weak bond holds you ; i'll not trust your word . #amndbots

250:624 my lord , this is my daughter here asleep ; and this @lysanderbot ; this @demetriusbot is ; #amndbots

455:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

251:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

559:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

559:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

559:522 and wilt not come ? come , recreant ; come , thou child ; i'll whip thee with a rod : he is defiled #amndbots

45:171 for lack of tread , are undistinguishable : the human mortals want their winter here ; #amndbots

457:471 disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest , to thy peril , thou aby it dear . -- #amndbots

355:477 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

560:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

560:806 now is the mural down between the two neighbours . #amndbots

46:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

253:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

150:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

458:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

356:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

254:190 perchance till after @theseusshakebot ' wedding-day . if you will patiently dance in our round , #amndbots

151:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

47:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

151:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

48:4 like to a step-dame or a dowager , long withering out a young man's revenue . #amndbots

459:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

562:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

254:703 lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend #amndbots

562:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

460:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

358:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

563:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

359:171 for lack of tread , are undistinguishable : the human mortals want their winter here ; #amndbots

461:190 perchance till after @theseusshakebot ' wedding-day . if you will patiently dance in our round , #amndbots

153:11 with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . #amndbots

49:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

49:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

564:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

461:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

153:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

153:636 they would have stol'n away , they would , @demetriusbot , thereby to have defeated you and me : #amndbots

153:651 these things seem small and undistinguishable , like far-off mountains turned into clouds . #amndbots

462:83 that's all one ; you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will . #amndbots

360:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

153:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

154:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

154:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

360:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

360:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

463:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

566:711 but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigur'd so together , #amndbots

566:835 why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . #amndbots

566:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

155:687 @bottomshakebot ! -- o most courageous day ! o most happy hour ! #amndbots

156:738 and what poor duty cannot do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed #amndbots

465:45 and come , @egeusbot ; you shall go with me ; i have some private schooling for you both . -- #amndbots

260:435 this is the woman , but not this the man . #amndbots

260:516 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

260:568 or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat . #amndbots

54:191 and see our moonlight revels , go with us ; if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts . #amndbots

157:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

465:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

54:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

363:687 @bottomshakebot ! -- o most courageous day ! o most happy hour ! #amndbots

466:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

466:613 despatch , i say , and find the forester . -- #amndbots

466:619 my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung #amndbots

466:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

364:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

262:512 up and down , up and down ; i will lead them up and down : i am fear'd in field and town . goblin , lead them up and down . #amndbots

365:525 follow my voice ; we'll try no manhood here . #amndbots

57:43 i must confess that i have heard so much , and with @demetriusbot thought to have spoke thereof ; #amndbots

468:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

263:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

366:723 tearing the thracian singer in their rage . ' that is an old device , and it was play'd #amndbots

263:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

263:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

263:738 and what poor duty cannot do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed #amndbots

367:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

160:896 now are frolic ; not a mouse shall disturb this hallow'd house : i am sent with broom before , #amndbots

161:178 from our debate , from our dissension : we are their parents and original . #amndbots

572:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

161:218 the one i'll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood , #amndbots

367:437 so should the murder'd look ; and so should i , pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty : #amndbots

264:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

162:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

573:524 yea , art thou there ? #amndbots

265:618 seem'd all one mutual cry : i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder . #amndbots

265:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

162:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

59:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

59:513 here comes one . #amndbots

59:547 the man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well . #amndbots

266:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

266:819 the very best at a beast , my lord , that e'er i saw . #amndbots

60:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

370:46 for you , fair @hermiabot , look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will , #amndbots

163:820 true ; and a goose for his discretion . #amndbots

163:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

164:37 take time to pause ; and by the next new moon , -- the sealing-day betwixt my love and me #amndbots

370:408 and when she weeps , weeps every little flower ; lamenting some enforcèd chastity . #amndbots

61:82 nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; i have a beard coming . #amndbots

164:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

472:536 by day's approach look to be visited . #amndbots

370:634 that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ? #amndbots

61:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

267:914 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

165:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

371:736 he says they can do nothing in this kind . #amndbots

165:703 lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend #amndbots

166:41 scornful @lysanderbot ! true , he hath my love ; and what is mine my love shall render him ; #amndbots

269:283 brake our tiring-house ; and we will do it in action , as we will do it before the duke . #amndbots

166:165 therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea #amndbots

269:388 and light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes , to have my love to bed and to arise ; #amndbots

63:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

474:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

578:724 when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ' the thrice three muses mourning for the death #amndbots

578:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

64:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

271:113 mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse : for #amndbots

579:156 come from the farthest steep of india , but that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , #amndbots

271:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

168:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

374:223 you do impeach your modesty too much , to leave the city , and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not ; #amndbots

271:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

168:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

374:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

477:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

272:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

580:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

580:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

272:646 fair lovers , you are fortunately met : of this discourse we more will hear anon . -- @egeusbot , i will overbear your will ; #amndbots

375:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

375:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

580:812 here come two noble beasts in , a moon and a lion . #amndbots

169:734 i love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged , and duty in his service perishing . #amndbots

376:61 duke and duchess on his wedding-day at night . #amndbots

169:807 no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning . #amndbots

478:107 why , what you will . #amndbots

478:113 mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse : for #amndbots

67:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

67:545 when thou wak'st , thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye : and the country proverb known , #amndbots

479:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

582:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

479:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

274:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

479:727 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

377:731 i will hear that play ; for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it . #amndbots

479:772 no wonder , my lord : one lion may , when many asses do . #amndbots

479:819 the very best at a beast , my lord , that e'er i saw . #amndbots

377:901 first , rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note ; hand in hand , with fairy grace , #amndbots

583:40 relent , sweet @hermiabot ; -- and , @lysanderbot , yield thy crazed title to my certain right . #amndbots

275:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

275:506 they wilfully exile themselves from light , and must for aye consort with black-brow'd night . #amndbots

172:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

69:806 now is the mural down between the two neighbours . #amndbots

481:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

481:652 it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream . -- do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ? #amndbots

173:469 @lysanderbot , keep thy @hermiabot ; i will none : if e'er i lov'd her , all that love is gone . #amndbots

379:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

173:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

70:314 yes , it doth shine that night . #amndbots

380:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

71:705 one sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; that is the madman : the lover , all as frantic , #amndbots

71:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

278:476 quick , come , -- #amndbots

175:386 feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; #amndbots

586:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

278:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

586:753 this fellow doth not stand upon points . #amndbots

176:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

279:376 i am a spirit of no common rate , -- the summer still doth tend upon my state ; and i do love thee : therefore , go with me , #amndbots

484:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

587:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

383:31 either to die the death , or to abjure for ever the society of men . therefore , fair @hermiabot , question your desires , #amndbots

280:50 of something nearly that concerns yourselves . #amndbots

176:818 a very gentle beast , and of a good conscience . #amndbots

73:826 he is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference . #amndbots

73:852 this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad . #amndbots

177:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

178:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

384:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

178:104 you can play no part but pyramus ; for pyramus is a sweet-faced man ; a proper man , as one shall see in a summer's #amndbots

384:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

486:386 feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; #amndbots

384:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

75:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

76:575 so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist , -- the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm . #amndbots

179:897 to sweep the dust behind the door . #amndbots

488:172 no night is now with hymn or carol blest : -- therefore the moon , the governess of floods , #amndbots

283:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

179:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

386:416 while she was in her dull and sleeping hour , a crew of patches , rude mechanicals , #amndbots

591:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

488:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

591:716 between our after-supper and bed-time ? where is our usual manager of mirth ? what revels are in hand ? is there no play #amndbots

488:852 this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad . #amndbots

388:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

78:568 or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat . #amndbots

78:598 music , ho ! music ; such as charmeth sleep . #amndbots

388:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

182:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

490:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

285:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

593:644 but , like a sickness , did i loathe this food ; but , as in health , come to my natural taste , #amndbots

490:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

182:620 with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like thessalian bulls ; #amndbots

286:50 of something nearly that concerns yourselves . #amndbots

80:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

389:604 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

80:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

286:810 it must be your imagination then , and not theirs . #amndbots

491:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

491:862 how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ? #amndbots

390:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

492:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

185:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

82:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

391:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

185:386 feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; #amndbots

185:409 tie up my love's tongue , bring him silently . #amndbots

288:625 this @helenashakebot , old nedar's @helenashakebot : i wonder of their being here together . #amndbots

596:636 they would have stol'n away , they would , @demetriusbot , thereby to have defeated you and me : #amndbots

185:470 my heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd; and now to helen is it home return'd , there to remain . #amndbots

289:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

83:14 thanks , good @egeusbot : what's the news with thee ? #amndbots

597:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

83:620 with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like thessalian bulls ; #amndbots

83:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

495:477 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

84:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

495:599 now when thou wak'st , with thine own fool's eyes peep . #amndbots

85:35 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage : but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd #amndbots

496:619 my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung #amndbots

394:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

600:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

600:387 the honey bags steal from the humble-bees , and , for nigh t-t apers , crop their waxen thighs , #amndbots

395:407 come , wait upon him ; lead him to my bower . the moon , methinks , looks with a watery eye ; #amndbots

600:437 so should the murder'd look ; and so should i , pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty : #amndbots

497:446 which now in some slight measure it will pay , if for his tender here i make some stay . #amndbots

189:534 nay , then , thou mock'st me . thou shalt buy this dear , if ever i thy face by daylight see : #amndbots

86:812 here come two noble beasts in , a moon and a lion . #amndbots

396:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

396:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

191:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

602:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

602:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

294:881 pyramus , and hang'd himself in thisbe's garter , it would have #amndbots

603:35 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage : but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd #amndbots

88:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

89:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

398:915 so , good night unto you all . give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends . #amndbots

604:20 and stol'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair , rings , gawds , conceits , #amndbots

89:617 such gallant chiding ; for , besides the groves , the skies , the fountains , every region near #amndbots

296:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

501:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

501:727 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

193:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

501:861 with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass . #amndbots

194:516 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

297:810 it must be your imagination then , and not theirs . #amndbots

91:424 he murder cries , and help from athens calls . their sense thus weak , lost with their fears , thus strong , #amndbots

503:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

91:531 abide me , if thou dar'st; for well i wot thou runn'st before me , shifting every place ; #amndbots

503:42 and she is mine ; and all my right of her i do estate unto @demetriusbot . #amndbots

401:58 is all our company here ? #amndbots

401:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

298:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

401:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

298:755 his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . who is next ? #amndbots

503:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

401:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

606:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

299:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

504:840 well roared , lion . #amndbots

505:14 thanks , good @egeusbot : what's the news with thee ? #amndbots

403:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

93:842 well shone , moon . -- truly , the moon shines with a good grace . #amndbots

505:625 this @helenashakebot , old nedar's @helenashakebot : i wonder of their being here together . #amndbots

608:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

197:479 no , sir , she shall not , though you take her part . #amndbots

505:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

300:735 why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing . #amndbots

301:550 come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , while i thy amiable cheeks do coy , #amndbots

301:568 or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat . #amndbots

301:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

198:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

198:450 then fate o'er-rules , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath . #amndbots

198:469 @lysanderbot , keep thy @hermiabot ; i will none : if e'er i lov'd her , all that love is gone . #amndbots

95:220 hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more . #amndbots

95:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

610:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

611:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

200:178 from our debate , from our dissension : we are their parents and original . #amndbots

611:471 disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest , to thy peril , thou aby it dear . -- #amndbots

508:523 that draws a sword on thee . #amndbots

201:4 like to a step-dame or a dowager , long withering out a young man's revenue . #amndbots

97:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

98:11 with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . #amndbots

201:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

612:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

304:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

407:648 and , for the morning now is something worn , our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside . -- #amndbots

304:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

612:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

201:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

202:58 is all our company here ? #amndbots

510:248 to make my small elves coats ; and some keep back the clamorous owl , that nightly hoots and wonders #amndbots

613:319 of moonshine . then there is another thing : we must have a wall in the great chamber ; for pyramus and thisby , says the #amndbots

613:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

613:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

408:375 out of this wood do not desire to go ; thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . #amndbots

305:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

409:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

202:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

99:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

99:880 need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played #amndbots

511:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

100:522 and wilt not come ? come , recreant ; come , thou child ; i'll whip thee with a rod : he is defiled #amndbots

307:114 if we meet in the city , we shall be dogg'd with company , and our #amndbots

100:616 i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear with hounds of sparta : never did i hear #amndbots

410:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

307:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

512:174 the seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; and on old hyem's thin and icy crown #amndbots

204:21 knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , -- messengers of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth ; -- #amndbots

410:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

204:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

204:883 discharged . but come , your bergomask ; let your epilogue alone . #amndbots

204:888 a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity . #amndbots

102:35 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage : but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd #amndbots

102:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

205:489 as this their jangling i esteem a sport . #amndbots

102:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

102:568 or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat . #amndbots

309:95 you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring . #amndbots

102:598 music , ho ! music ; such as charmeth sleep . #amndbots

514:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

206:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

310:29 in himself he is : but , in this kind , wanting your father's voice , the other must be held the worthier . #amndbots

618:38 for everlasting bond of fellowship , -- upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father's will ; #amndbots

206:886 i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch'd . #amndbots

413:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

1:23 to stubborn harshness . -- and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace #amndbots

104:368 i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note . so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; #amndbots

618:829 he dares not come there for the candle : for , you see , it is already in snuff . #amndbots

413:860 no die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one . #amndbots

414:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

104:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

2:36 than that which , withering on the virgin thorn , grows , lives , and dies , in single blessedness . #amndbots

415:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

517:515 here , villain ; drawn and ready . where art thou ? #amndbots

620:701 ' tis strange , my @theseusshakebot , that these lovers speak of . #amndbots

3:14 thanks , good @egeusbot : what's the news with thee ? #amndbots

106:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

518:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

621:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

416:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

621:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

518:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

4:39 or else to wed @demetriusbot , as he would ; or on diana's altar to protest for aye austerity and single life . #amndbots

313:740 make periods in the midst of sentences , throttle their practis'd accent in their fears , #amndbots

4:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

4:512 up and down , up and down ; i will lead them up and down : i am fear'd in field and town . goblin , lead them up and down . #amndbots

314:439 i had rather give his carcass to my hounds . #amndbots

314:465 * awaking . * o helen , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine ! to what , my love , shall i compare thine eyne ? #amndbots

4:701 ' tis strange , my @theseusshakebot , that these lovers speak of . #amndbots

108:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

519:550 come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , while i thy amiable cheeks do coy , #amndbots

314:547 the man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well . #amndbots

211:368 i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note . so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; #amndbots

108:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

108:716 between our after-supper and bed-time ? where is our usual manager of mirth ? what revels are in hand ? is there no play #amndbots

108:823 discretion , and let us listen to the moon . #amndbots

109:45 and come , @egeusbot ; you shall go with me ; i have some private schooling for you both . -- #amndbots

623:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

109:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

109:521 thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars , #amndbots

316:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

316:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

109:808 this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard . #amndbots

213:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

316:376 i am a spirit of no common rate , -- the summer still doth tend upon my state ; and i do love thee : therefore , go with me , #amndbots

419:379 that thou shalt like an airy spirit go . -- @peasblossombot ! @cobwebbot ! @mothshakebot ! and @mustardseedbot ! #amndbots

624:386 feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; #amndbots

317:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

214:28 by him imprinted , and within his power to leave the figure , or disfigure it . @demetriusbot is a worthy gentleman . #amndbots

625:635 enough , enough , my lord ; you have enough ; i beg the law , the law upon his head . -- #amndbots

111:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

111:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

111:488 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

8:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

626:158 to give their bed joy and prosperity . #amndbots

626:165 therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea #amndbots

214:897 to sweep the dust behind the door . #amndbots

523:166 contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , hath every pelting river made so proud #amndbots

626:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

421:828 this is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ' the moon ? #amndbots

215:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

319:113 mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse : for #amndbots

215:852 this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad . #amndbots

422:897 to sweep the dust behind the door . #amndbots

319:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

113:504 troop home to churchyards : damned spirits all , that in cross-ways and floods have burial , #amndbots

525:42 and she is mine ; and all my right of her i do estate unto @demetriusbot . #amndbots

525:98 an you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were #amndbots

525:107 why , what you will . #amndbots

320:157 your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love , to @theseusshakebot must be wedded ; and you come #amndbots

217:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

423:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

11:11 with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . #amndbots

525:724 when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ' the thrice three muses mourning for the death #amndbots

11:28 by him imprinted , and within his power to leave the figure , or disfigure it . @demetriusbot is a worthy gentleman . #amndbots

525:822 his discretion , i am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . it is well ; leave it to his #amndbots

629:423 so at his sight away his fellows fly : and at our stamp here , o'er and o'er one falls ; #amndbots

321:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

629:435 this is the woman , but not this the man . #amndbots

526:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

218:417 that work for bread upon athenian stalls , were met together to rehearse a play #amndbots

218:711 but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigur'd so together , #amndbots

322:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

527:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

630:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

13:28 by him imprinted , and within his power to leave the figure , or disfigure it . @demetriusbot is a worthy gentleman . #amndbots

322:722 we'll none of that : that have i told my love , in glory of my kinsman hercules . ' the riot of the tipsy bacchanals , #amndbots

13:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

220:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

220:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

14:16 stand forth , @demetriusbot . -- my noble lord , this man hath my consent to marry her : -- #amndbots

528:754 indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder ; a sound , but not in government . #amndbots

220:595 how came these things to pass ? o , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now ! #amndbots

117:390 nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies . #amndbots

528:835 why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . #amndbots

220:651 these things seem small and undistinguishable , like far-off mountains turned into clouds . #amndbots

14:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

324:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

222:25 which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death ; according to our law immediately provided in that case . #amndbots

530:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

530:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

428:574 sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms . fairies , be gone , and be all ways away . #amndbots

222:376 i am a spirit of no common rate , -- the summer still doth tend upon my state ; and i do love thee : therefore , go with me , #amndbots

325:593 my @oberonbot ! what visions have i seen ! methought i was enamour'd of an ass . #amndbots

222:466 crystal is muddy . o , how ripe in show thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow ! #amndbots

119:221 do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ? or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i cannot love you ? #amndbots

16:806 now is the mural down between the two neighbours . #amndbots

429:613 despatch , i say , and find the forester . -- #amndbots

531:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

532:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

17:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

224:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

635:364 * waking . * what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ? #amndbots

327:379 that thou shalt like an airy spirit go . -- @peasblossombot ! @cobwebbot ! @mothshakebot ! and @mustardseedbot ! #amndbots

532:387 the honey bags steal from the humble-bees , and , for nigh t-t apers , crop their waxen thighs , #amndbots

532:466 crystal is muddy . o , how ripe in show thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow ! #amndbots

224:310 well , it shall be so . but there is two hard things ; that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber : for , you know , #amndbots

224:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

225:26 what say you , @hermiabot ? be advis'd , fair maid : to you your father should be as a god ; #amndbots

225:43 i must confess that i have heard so much , and with @demetriusbot thought to have spoke thereof ; #amndbots

122:26 what say you , @hermiabot ? be advis'd , fair maid : to you your father should be as a god ; #amndbots

18:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

122:113 mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse : for #amndbots

533:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

328:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

431:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

431:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

328:896 now are frolic ; not a mouse shall disturb this hallow'd house : i am sent with broom before , #amndbots

534:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

226:92 you , pyramus ' father ; myself , thisby's father ; -- @snugshakebot , #amndbots

329:320 story , did talk through the chink of a wall . #amndbots

637:342 ninus ' tomb , man : why , you must not speak that yet : that you answer to pyramus . you speak all your part at once , #amndbots

534:347 o monstrous ! o strange ! we are haunted . pray , masters ! fly , masters ! help ! #amndbots

433:14 thanks , good @egeusbot : what's the news with thee ? #amndbots

226:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

227:50 of something nearly that concerns yourselves . #amndbots

227:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

638:677 you must say paragon : a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught . #amndbots

433:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

21:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

124:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

639:90 robin @starvelingbot , you must play thisby's mother . -- tom @snoutshakebot , the tinker . #amndbots

331:141 thou speak'st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to @oberonbot , and make him smile , #amndbots

536:185 which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following , -- her womb then rich with my young squire , -- #amndbots

434:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

228:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

434:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

435:35 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage : but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd #amndbots

537:43 i must confess that i have heard so much , and with @demetriusbot thought to have spoke thereof ; #amndbots

332:521 thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars , #amndbots

332:547 the man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well . #amndbots

229:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

640:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

641:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

641:735 why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing . #amndbots

230:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

334:450 then fate o'er-rules , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath . #amndbots

437:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

128:141 thou speak'st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to @oberonbot , and make him smile , #amndbots

231:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

128:342 ninus ' tomb , man : why , you must not speak that yet : that you answer to pyramus . you speak all your part at once , #amndbots

539:829 he dares not come there for the candle : for , you see , it is already in snuff . #amndbots

642:865 methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus : i hope she will be brief . #amndbots

25:832 stay the time . #amndbots

643:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

25:888 a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity . #amndbots

540:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

26:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

541:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

541:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

130:165 therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea #amndbots

541:638 my lord , fair helen told me of their stealth , of this their purpose hither to this wood ; #amndbots

439:641 melted as the snow -- seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gawd which in my childhood i did dote upon : #amndbots

541:676 yea , and the best person too : and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice . #amndbots

131:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

646:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

234:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

28:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

28:477 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

235:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

441:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

543:420 an ass's nowl i fixèd on his head ; anon , his thisbe must be answered , #amndbots

132:83 that's all one ; you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will . #amndbots

338:571 i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel's hoard , and fetch thee new nuts . #amndbots

544:187 but she , being mortal , of that boy did die ; and for her sake do i rear up her boy : #amndbots

132:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

29:753 this fellow doth not stand upon points . #amndbots

544:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

647:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

443:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

545:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

30:428 @titaniabot wak'd , and straightway lov'd an ass . #amndbots

237:175 an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is , as in mockery , set : the spring , the summer , #amndbots

340:376 i am a spirit of no common rate , -- the summer still doth tend upon my state ; and i do love thee : therefore , go with me , #amndbots

340:385 be kind and courteous to this gentleman ; hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes ; #amndbots

443:444 there is no following her in this fierce vein : here , therefore , for a while i will remain . #amndbots

135:10 @hippolytabot , i woo'd thee with my sword , and won thy love doing thee injuries ; but i will wed thee in another key , #amndbots

31:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

135:82 nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; i have a beard coming . #amndbots

649:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

649:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

444:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

546:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

32:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

32:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

135:604 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

547:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

650:152 what , jealous @oberonbot ! fairies , skip hence ; i have forsworn his bed and company . #amndbots

342:152 what , jealous @oberonbot ! fairies , skip hence ; i have forsworn his bed and company . #amndbots

342:165 therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea #amndbots

32:454 i go , i go ; look how i go , -- swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow . #amndbots

32:476 quick , come , -- #amndbots

239:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

650:880 need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played #amndbots

343:44 but , being over-full of self-affairs , my mind did lose it . -- but , @demetriusbot , come ; #amndbots

240:424 he murder cries , and help from athens calls . their sense thus weak , lost with their fears , thus strong , #amndbots

137:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

343:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

344:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

549:729 what are they that do play it ? #amndbots

652:730 and we will hear it . #amndbots

549:731 i will hear that play ; for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it . #amndbots

652:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

241:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

241:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

447:886 i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch'd . #amndbots

241:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

241:722 we'll none of that : that have i told my love , in glory of my kinsman hercules . ' the riot of the tipsy bacchanals , #amndbots

241:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

448:11 with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . #amndbots

138:915 so , good night unto you all . give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends . #amndbots

242:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

448:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

653:821 not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose . #amndbots

550:866 a mote will turn the balance , which pyramus , which thisbe , is the better . #amndbots

139:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

139:470 my heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd; and now to helen is it home return'd , there to remain . #amndbots

139:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

654:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

551:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

551:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

347:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

141:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

244:472 look where thy love comes ; yonder is thy dear . #amndbots

552:701 ' tis strange , my @theseusshakebot , that these lovers speak of . #amndbots

38:20 and stol'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair , rings , gawds , conceits , #amndbots

244:642 and all the faith , the virtue of my heart , the object and the pleasure of mine eye , #amndbots

141:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

451:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

38:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

451:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

452:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

246:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

452:534 nay , then , thou mock'st me . thou shalt buy this dear , if ever i thy face by daylight see : #amndbots

657:535 now , go thy way . faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed . -- #amndbots

246:358 bless thee , @bottomshakebot ! bless thee ! thou art translated . #amndbots

39:866 a mote will turn the balance , which pyramus , which thisbe , is the better . #amndbots

143:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

247:86 no , no , you must play pyramus ; and , @fluteshakebot , you thisby . #amndbots

144:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

41:3 another moon ; but , oh , methinks , how slow this old moon wanes ! she lingers my desires , #amndbots

659:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

454:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

41:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

454:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

659:375 out of this wood do not desire to go ; thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . #amndbots

145:21 knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , -- messengers of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth ; -- #amndbots

659:465 * awaking . * o helen , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine ! to what , my love , shall i compare thine eyne ? #amndbots

41:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

454:466 crystal is muddy . o , how ripe in show thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow ! #amndbots

659:520 speak . in some bush ? where dost thou hide thy head ? #amndbots

145:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

145:746 let him approach . #amndbots

43:141 thou speak'st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to @oberonbot , and make him smile , #amndbots

455:897 to sweep the dust behind the door . #amndbots

558:226 i will not stay thy questions ; let me go : or , if thou follow me , do not believe #amndbots

558:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

661:246 come , now a roundel and a fairy song ; then , for the third part of a minute , hence ; #amndbots

558:248 to make my small elves coats ; and some keep back the clamorous owl , that nightly hoots and wonders #amndbots

43:479 no , sir , she shall not , though you take her part . #amndbots

43:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

147:22 with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart ; turned her obedience , which is due to me , #amndbots

147:154 then i must be thy lady ; but i know when thou hast stol'n away from fairy-land , and in the shape of corin sat all day , #amndbots

558:607 come , my lord ; and in our flight , tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found #amndbots

250:771 i wonder if the lion be to speak . #amndbots

354:80 what is thisby ? a wandering knight ? #amndbots

147:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

251:8 turn melancholy forth to funerals -- the pale companion is not for our pomp . -- #amndbots

44:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

44:735 why , gentle sweet , you shall see no such thing . #amndbots

251:545 when thou wak'st , thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye : and the country proverb known , #amndbots

560:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

355:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

251:915 so , good night unto you all . give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends . #amndbots

45:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

252:167 that they have overborne their continents : the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain , #amndbots

45:618 seem'd all one mutual cry : i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder . #amndbots

458:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

252:220 hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more . #amndbots

663:566 what , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ? #amndbots

663:886 i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch'd . #amndbots

664:13 happy be @theseusshakebot , our renowned duke ! #amndbots

252:736 he says they can do nothing in this kind . #amndbots

356:20 and stol'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair , rings , gawds , conceits , #amndbots

664:31 either to die the death , or to abjure for ever the society of men . therefore , fair @hermiabot , question your desires , #amndbots

252:807 no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning . #amndbots

664:82 nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; i have a beard coming . #amndbots

664:88 robin @starvelingbot , the tailor . #amndbots

459:111 parts : and i am to entreat you , request you , and desire you , to #amndbots

356:186 would imitate ; and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise . #amndbots

459:190 perchance till after @theseusshakebot ' wedding-day . if you will patiently dance in our round , #amndbots

149:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

46:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

459:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

356:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

46:771 i wonder if the lion be to speak . #amndbots

253:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

664:648 and , for the morning now is something worn , our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside . -- #amndbots

150:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

562:185 which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following , -- her womb then rich with my young squire , -- #amndbots

665:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

460:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

562:708 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

665:818 a very gentle beast , and of a good conscience . #amndbots

254:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

562:823 his discretion , i am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . it is well ; leave it to his #amndbots

666:451 then fate o'er-rules , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath . #amndbots

563:489 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

152:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

461:599 now when thou wak'st , with thine own fool's eyes peep . #amndbots

564:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

152:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

667:68 you , nick @bottomshakebot , are set down for pyramus . #amndbots

667:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

564:615 we will , fair queen , up to the mountain's top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction . #amndbots

462:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

667:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

667:634 that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ? #amndbots

667:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

359:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

50:38 for everlasting bond of fellowship , -- upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father's will ; #amndbots

360:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

360:512 up and down , up and down ; i will lead them up and down : i am fear'd in field and town . goblin , lead them up and down . #amndbots

360:523 that draws a sword on thee . #amndbots

257:625 this @helenashakebot , old nedar's @helenashakebot : i wonder of their being here together . #amndbots

51:727 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

566:705 one sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; that is the madman : the lover , all as frantic , #amndbots

465:268 this flower's force in stirring love . night and silence ! who is here ? weeds of athens he doth wear : #amndbots

362:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

155:892 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

362:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

156:311 pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight . #amndbots

362:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

259:640 and i in fury hither follow'd them , fair @helenashakebot in fancy following me . #amndbots

259:644 is only @helenashakebot . to her , my lord , was i betroth'd ere i saw @hermiabot : #amndbots

259:820 the very best at a beast , my lord , that e'er i saw . #amndbots

157:46 for you , fair @hermiabot , look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will , #amndbots

53:717 between our after-supper and bed-time ? where is our usual manager of mirth ? what revels are in hand ? is there no play #amndbots

54:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

569:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

261:83 that's all one ; you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will . #amndbots

569:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

569:722 we'll none of that : that have i told my love , in glory of my kinsman hercules . ' the riot of the tipsy bacchanals , #amndbots

158:683 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

159:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

56:141 thou speak'st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to @oberonbot , and make him smile , #amndbots

262:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

56:347 o monstrous ! o strange ! we are haunted . pray , masters ! fly , masters ! help ! #amndbots

469:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

366:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

56:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

56:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

263:379 that thou shalt like an airy spirit go . -- @peasblossombot ! @cobwebbot ! @mothshakebot ! and @mustardseedbot ! #amndbots

469:628 it is , my lord . #amndbots

674:640 but , my good lord , i wot not by what power , -- but by some power it is , -- my love to @hermiabot , #amndbots

674:644 but , like a sickness , did i loathe this food ; but , as in health , come to my natural taste , #amndbots

56:865 methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus : i hope she will be brief . #amndbots

366:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

57:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

263:823 discretion , and let us listen to the moon . #amndbots

263:861 with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass . #amndbots

161:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

471:28 by him imprinted , and within his power to leave the figure , or disfigure it . @demetriusbot is a worthy gentleman . #amndbots

161:504 troop home to churchyards : damned spirits all , that in cross-ways and floods have burial , #amndbots

471:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

58:489 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

573:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

58:680 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

162:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

676:519 @lysanderbot ! speak again . thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ? #amndbots

59:48 to death , or to a vow of single life . -- come , my @hippolytabot : what cheer , my love ? #amndbots

573:822 his discretion , i am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . it is well ; leave it to his #amndbots

573:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

677:27 one that compos'd your beauties : yea , and one to whom you are but as a form in wax , #amndbots

369:35 to undergo such maiden pilgrimage : but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd #amndbots

472:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

163:416 while she was in her dull and sleeping hour , a crew of patches , rude mechanicals , #amndbots

266:912 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

678:225 i'll run from thee , and hide me in the brakes , and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts . #amndbots

678:275 i charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus . #amndbots

575:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

60:571 i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel's hoard , and fetch thee new nuts . #amndbots

678:375 out of this wood do not desire to go ; thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . #amndbots

575:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

268:455 i go , i go ; look how i go , -- swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow . #amndbots

165:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

475:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

62:368 i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note . so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; #amndbots

165:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

166:44 but , being over-full of self-affairs , my mind did lose it . -- but , @demetriusbot , come ; #amndbots

475:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

166:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

270:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

681:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

578:506 they wilfully exile themselves from light , and must for aye consort with black-brow'd night . #amndbots

374:16 stand forth , @demetriusbot . -- my noble lord , this man hath my consent to marry her : -- #amndbots

682:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

579:115 devices known . in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties , such as our play wants . i pray you , fail me not . #amndbots

271:47 or else the law of athens yields you up , -- which by no means we may extenuate , -- #amndbots

167:822 his discretion , i am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . it is well ; leave it to his #amndbots

477:835 why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . #amndbots

374:876 ay , and wall too . #amndbots

374:901 first , rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note ; hand in hand , with fairy grace , #amndbots

65:185 which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following , -- her womb then rich with my young squire , -- #amndbots

580:5 four days will quickly steep themselves in nights ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; #amndbots

375:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

65:220 hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more . #amndbots

683:60 here is the scroll of every man's name , which is thought fit , through all athens , to play in our interlude before the #amndbots

271:854 beshrew my heart , but i pity the man . #amndbots

683:166 contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , hath every pelting river made so proud #amndbots

272:27 one that compos'd your beauties : yea , and one to whom you are but as a form in wax , #amndbots

375:218 the one i'll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood , #amndbots

375:221 do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ? or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i cannot love you ? #amndbots

683:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

272:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

375:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

478:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

580:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

169:3 another moon ; but , oh , methinks , how slow this old moon wanes ! she lingers my desires , #amndbots

65:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

685:20 and stol'n the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair , rings , gawds , conceits , #amndbots

582:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

685:34 chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon . thrice-blessed they that master so their blood #amndbots

582:133 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

378:828 this is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ' the moon ? #amndbots

172:445 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe ; #amndbots

172:463 that befall preposterously . #amndbots

481:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

687:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

483:674 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

380:682 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

277:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

71:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

380:915 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

174:605 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

484:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

689:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

71:421 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

71:429 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

175:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

587:476 quick , come , -- #amndbots

485:515 here , villain ; drawn and ready . where art thou ? #amndbots

690:521 speak . in some bush ? where dost thou hide thy head ? #amndbots

382:540 yet but three ? come one more ; two of both kinds makes up four . here she comes , curst and sad : -- cupid is a knavish lad , #amndbots

690:624 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

72:888 a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity . #amndbots

72:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

73:131 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

690:893 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

486:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

486:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

487:369 and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me , on the first view , to say , to swear , i love thee . #amndbots

281:181 set your heart at rest ; the fairy-land buys not the child of me . his mother was a vot'ress of my order : #amndbots

74:652 it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream . -- do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ? #amndbots

487:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

178:45 and come , @egeusbot ; you shall go with me ; i have some private schooling for you both . -- #amndbots

692:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

487:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

589:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

489:184 when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive , and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind ; #amndbots

489:248 some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds ; some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings , #amndbots

386:268 this flower's force in stirring love . night and silence ! who is here ? weeds of athens he doth wear : #amndbots

694:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

694:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

591:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

283:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

179:820 true ; and a goose for his discretion . #amndbots

76:552 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

180:78 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

76:739 and what poor duty cannot do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed #amndbots

76:833 stay the time . #amndbots

592:513 here comes one . #amndbots

284:488 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

181:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

284:605 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

593:47 or else the law of athens yields you up , -- which by no means we may extenuate , -- #amndbots

285:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

285:712 but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigur'd so together , #amndbots

285:717 between our after-supper and bed-time ? where is our usual manager of mirth ? what revels are in hand ? is there no play #amndbots

492:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

594:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

389:517 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

286:416 while she was in her dull and sleeping hour , a crew of patches , rude mechanicals , #amndbots

594:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

697:889 a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity . #amndbots

390:32 know of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father's choice , #amndbots

595:33 you can endure the livery of a nun ; for aye to be shady cloister mew'd , to live a barren sister all your life , #amndbots

390:653 why , then , we are awake : let's follow him ; and by the way let us recount our dreams . #amndbots

699:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

699:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

184:894 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

699:521 thou coward , art thou bragging to the stars , telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars , #amndbots

596:701 ' tis strange , my @theseusshakebot , that these lovers speak of . #amndbots

494:821 not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose . #amndbots

494:852 this passion , and the death of a dear friend , would go near to make a man look sad . #amndbots

495:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

700:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

83:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

598:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

496:145 sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me ; then slip i from her bum , down topples she , #amndbots

701:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

187:31 either to die the death , or to abjure for ever the society of men . therefore , fair @hermiabot , question your desires , #amndbots

83:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

701:674 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

496:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

393:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

496:888 a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity . #amndbots

188:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

703:407 come , wait upon him ; lead him to my bower . the moon , methinks , looks with a watery eye ; #amndbots

85:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

703:524 yea , art thou there ? #amndbots

395:552 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

85:844 well moused , lion . #amndbots

600:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

704:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

294:88 robin @starvelingbot , the tailor . #amndbots

602:673 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

397:685 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

602:678 you must say paragon : a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught . #amndbots

501:42 and she is mine ; and all my right of her i do estate unto @demetriusbot . #amndbots

398:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

88:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

89:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

192:428 @titaniabot wak'd , and straightway lov'd an ass . #amndbots

398:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

501:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

707:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

604:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

192:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

502:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

296:34 chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon . thrice-blessed they that master so their blood #amndbots

192:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

502:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

89:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

193:4 like to a step-dame or a dowager , long withering out a young man's revenue . #amndbots

400:512 up and down , up and down ; i will lead them up and down : i am fear'd in field and town . goblin , lead them up and down . #amndbots

194:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

709:15 full of vexation come i , with complaint against my child , my daughter @hermiabot . -- #amndbots

297:832 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

91:310 well , it shall be so . but there is two hard things ; that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber : for , you know , #amndbots

91:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

297:877 ay , and wall too . #amndbots

297:883 been a fine tragedy : and so it is , truly ; and very notably #amndbots

91:347 o monstrous ! o strange ! we are haunted . pray , masters ! fly , masters ! help ! #amndbots

194:703 lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend #amndbots

298:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

92:546 that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown : jack shall have jill ; nought shall go ill ; #amndbots

505:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

299:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

299:462 then will two at once woo one , -- that must needs be sport alone ; and those things do best please me #amndbots

607:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

299:574 sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms . fairies , be gone , and be all ways away . #amndbots

93:98 an you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were #amndbots

505:842 well shone , moon . -- truly , the moon shines with a good grace . #amndbots

607:882 been a fine tragedy : and so it is , truly ; and very notably #amndbots

506:33 you can endure the livery of a nun ; for aye to be shady cloister mew'd , to live a barren sister all your life , #amndbots

403:724 when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ' the thrice three muses mourning for the death #amndbots

300:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

94:435 this is the woman , but not this the man . #amndbots

712:653 why , then , we are awake : let's follow him ; and by the way let us recount our dreams . #amndbots

301:519 @lysanderbot ! speak again . thou runaway , thou coward , art thou fled ? #amndbots

95:39 or else to wed @demetriusbot , as he would ; or on diana's altar to protest for aye austerity and single life . #amndbots

198:470 my heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd; and now to helen is it home return'd , there to remain . #amndbots

611:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

96:432 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

509:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

406:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

611:423 so at his sight away his fellows fly : and at our stamp here , o'er and o'er one falls ; #amndbots

406:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

200:45 and come , @egeusbot ; you shall go with me ; i have some private schooling for you both . -- #amndbots

303:378 and sing , while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep : and i will purge thy mortal grossness so #amndbots

96:781 pyramus draws near the wall ; silence . #amndbots

200:173 pale in her anger , washes all the air , that rheumatic diseases do abound : and thorough this distemperature we see #amndbots

200:177 by their increase , now knows not which is which : and this same progeny of evils comes #amndbots

406:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

511:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

613:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

408:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

408:324 if that may be , then all is well . come , sit down , every mother's son , and rehearse your parts . pyramus , you begin : #amndbots

511:409 tie up my love's tongue , bring him silently . #amndbots

408:524 yea , art thou there ? #amndbots

202:90 robin @starvelingbot , you must play thisby's mother . -- tom @snoutshakebot , the tinker . #amndbots

98:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

613:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

98:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

202:169 the fold stands empty in the drowned field , and crows are fatted with the murrion flock ; #amndbots

408:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

99:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

305:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

512:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

203:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

100:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

203:440 you spend your passion on a mispris'd mood : i am not guilty of @lysanderbot's blood ; #amndbots

513:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

203:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

410:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

203:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

513:620 with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like thessalian bulls ; #amndbots

410:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

719:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

719:248 to make my small elves coats ; and some keep back the clamorous owl , that nightly hoots and wonders #amndbots

616:532 and dar'st not stand , nor look me in the face . where art thou ? #amndbots

308:502 my fairy lord , this must be done with haste , for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast ; #amndbots

205:268 this flower's force in stirring love . night and silence ! who is here ? weeds of athens he doth wear : #amndbots

205:540 yet but three ? come one more ; two of both kinds makes up four . here she comes , curst and sad : -- cupid is a knavish lad , #amndbots

412:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

102:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

102:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

721:444 there is no following her in this fierce vein : here , therefore , for a while i will remain . #amndbots

721:463 that befall preposterously . #amndbots

516:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

207:273 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

413:892 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

208:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

2:217 i love thee not , therefore pursue me not . where is @lysanderbot and fair @hermiabot ? #amndbots

312:167 that they have overborne their continents : the ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain , #amndbots

723:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

723:423 so at his sight away his fellows fly : and at our stamp here , o'er and o'er one falls ; #amndbots

620:490 as this their jangling i esteem a sport . #amndbots

518:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

620:724 tearing the thracian singer in their rage . ' that is an old device , and it was play'd #amndbots

312:646 fair lovers , you are fortunately met : of this discourse we more will hear anon . -- @egeusbot , i will overbear your will ; #amndbots

313:912 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

210:652 it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream . -- do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ? #amndbots

725:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

417:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

4:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

622:681 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

520:705 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

725:835 why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . #amndbots

521:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

212:177 by their increase , now knows not which is which : and this same progeny of evils comes #amndbots

418:734 i love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged , and duty in his service perishing . #amndbots

418:755 his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . who is next ? #amndbots

315:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

418:826 he is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference . #amndbots

5:730 and we will hear it . #amndbots

623:882 been a fine tragedy : and so it is , truly ; and very notably #amndbots

727:16 stand forth , @demetriusbot . -- my noble lord , this man hath my consent to marry her : -- #amndbots

109:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

727:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

212:753 this fellow doth not stand upon points . #amndbots

7:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

7:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

728:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

420:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

7:652 it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream . -- do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ? #amndbots

728:840 well roared , lion . #amndbots

214:388 and light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes , to have my love to bed and to arise ; #amndbots

524:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

214:471 disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest , to thy peril , thou aby it dear . -- #amndbots

7:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

111:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

8:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

729:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

215:218 the one i'll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood , #amndbots

730:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

112:648 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

422:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

216:181 set your heart at rest ; the fairy-land buys not the child of me . his mother was a vot'ress of my order : #amndbots

112:893 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

112:897 now are frolic ; not a mouse shall disturb this hallow'd house : i am sent with broom before , #amndbots

9:628 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

422:723 tearing the thracian singer in their rage . ' that is an old device , and it was play'd #amndbots

9:636 enough , enough , my lord ; you have enough ; i beg the law , the law upon his head . -- #amndbots

422:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

10:95 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

526:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

10:130 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

320:811 if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men . #amndbots

732:476 quick , come , -- #amndbots

114:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

629:489 as this their jangling i esteem a sport . #amndbots

321:326 when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake ; and so every one according to his cue . #amndbots

732:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

11:450 then fate o'er-rules , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath . #amndbots

218:112 con them by to-morrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a #amndbots

11:462 then will two at once woo one , -- that must needs be sport alone ; and those things do best please me #amndbots

321:410 tie up my love's tongue , bring him silently . #amndbots

424:607 come , my lord ; and in our flight , tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found #amndbots

424:634 that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ? #amndbots

218:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

425:722 we'll none of that : that have i told my love , in glory of my kinsman hercules . ' the riot of the tipsy bacchanals , #amndbots

219:436 o , why rebuke you him that loves you so ? lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe . #amndbots

219:480 you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services . let her alone : speak not of @helenashakebot ; #amndbots

13:223 you do impeach your modesty too much , to leave the city , and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not ; #amndbots

529:387 the honey bags steal from the humble-bees , and , for nigh t-t apers , crop their waxen thighs , #amndbots

116:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

323:222 tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit ; for i am sick when i do look on thee . #amndbots

529:454 i go , i go ; look how i go , -- swifter than arrow from the tartar's bow . #amndbots

427:2 now , fair @hippolytabot , our nuptial hour draws on apace ; four happy days bring in #amndbots

632:7 go , @philostratebot , stir up the athenian youth to merriments ; awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth ; #amndbots

427:78 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

14:36 than that which , withering on the virgin thorn , grows , lives , and dies , in single blessedness . #amndbots

427:246 come , now a roundel and a fairy song ; then , for the third part of a minute , hence ; #amndbots

117:505 troop home to churchyards : damned spirits all , that in cross-ways and floods have burial , #amndbots

221:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

427:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

14:634 that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate , and fear no enmity ? #amndbots

735:745 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

118:50 of something nearly that concerns yourselves . #amndbots

324:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

736:181 set your heart at rest ; the fairy-land buys not the child of me . his mother was a vot'ress of my order : #amndbots

15:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

428:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

633:432 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

736:503 my fairy lord , this must be done with haste , for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast ; #amndbots

737:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

532:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

119:875 moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead . #amndbots

634:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

326:867 and thus she moans , videlicet . -- #amndbots

738:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

326:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

635:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

121:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

225:95 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

431:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

121:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

122:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

122:177 by their increase , now knows not which is which : and this same progeny of evils comes #amndbots

328:729 what are they that do play it ? #amndbots

535:25 which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death ; according to our law immediately provided in that case . #amndbots

122:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

637:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

328:891 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

19:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

122:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

432:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

638:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

123:753 this fellow doth not stand upon points . #amndbots

536:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

741:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

638:617 we will , fair queen , up to the mountain's top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction . #amndbots

638:621 my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung #amndbots

20:609 come , my lord ; and in our flight , tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found #amndbots

638:736 i love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged , and duty in his service perishing . #amndbots

330:569 or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat . #amndbots

227:375 out of this wood do not desire to go ; thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . #amndbots

330:645 but , like a sickness , did i loathe this food ; but , as in health , come to my natural taste , #amndbots

227:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

536:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

227:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

21:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

22:218 the one i'll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood , #amndbots

22:220 hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more . #amndbots

743:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

125:533 and dar'st not stand , nor look me in the face . where art thou ? #amndbots

538:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

640:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

125:682 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

229:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

125:824 discretion , and let us listen to the moon . #amndbots

229:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

126:247 some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds ; some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings , #amndbots

436:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

436:166 contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , hath every pelting river made so proud #amndbots

126:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

539:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

229:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

126:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

126:435 this is the woman , but not this the man . #amndbots

539:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

333:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

230:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

127:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

745:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

540:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

540:826 he is no crescent , and his horns are invisible within the circumference . #amndbots

24:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

334:653 why , then , we are awake : let's follow him ; and by the way let us recount our dreams . #amndbots

231:420 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

128:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

334:687 @bottomshakebot ! -- o most courageous day ! o most happy hour ! #amndbots

541:8 turn melancholy forth to funerals -- the pale companion is not for our pomp . -- #amndbots

231:489 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

438:32 know of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father's choice , #amndbots

643:32 know of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father's choice , #amndbots

438:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

747:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

747:466 crystal is muddy . o , how ripe in show thy lips , those kissing cherries , tempting grow ! #amndbots

542:479 i would i had your bond ; for i perceive a weak bond holds you ; i'll not trust your word . #amndbots

336:283 brake our tiring-house ; and we will do it in action , as we will do it before the duke . #amndbots

26:386 feed him with apricocks and dewberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries ; #amndbots

336:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

644:516 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

644:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

129:734 i love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged , and duty in his service perishing . #amndbots

542:627 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

747:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

337:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

645:571 i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel's hoard , and fetch thee new nuts . #amndbots

131:478 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

441:324 if that may be , then all is well . come , sit down , every mother's son , and rehearse your parts . pyramus , you begin : #amndbots

131:523 and wilt not come ? come , recreant ; come , thou child ; i'll whip thee with a rod : he is defiled #amndbots

131:526 follow my voice ; we'll try no manhood here . #amndbots

544:376 i am a spirit of no common rate , -- the summer still doth tend upon my state ; and i do love thee : therefore , go with me , #amndbots

338:185 which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following , -- her womb then rich with my young squire , -- #amndbots

234:881 need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played #amndbots

234:915 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

749:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

131:889 a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity . #amndbots

749:729 what are they that do play it ? #amndbots

236:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

751:112 con them by to-morrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a #amndbots

546:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

751:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

236:638 my lord , fair helen told me of their stealth , of this their purpose hither to this wood ; #amndbots

443:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

340:2 now , fair @hippolytabot , our nuptial hour draws on apace ; four happy days bring in #amndbots

236:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

340:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

648:218 i love thee not , therefore pursue me not . where is @lysanderbot and fair @hermiabot ? #amndbots

236:730 and we will hear it . #amndbots

133:506 they wilfully exile themselves from light , and must for aye consort with black-brow'd night . #amndbots

648:351 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

236:875 moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead . #amndbots

236:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

546:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

751:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

443:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

444:61 here is the scroll of every man's name , which is thought fit , through all athens , to play in our interlude before the #amndbots

752:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

134:291 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

237:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

341:271 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

238:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

649:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

752:897 now are frolic ; not a mouse shall disturb this hallow'd house : i am sent with broom before , #amndbots

238:465 * awaking . * o helen , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine ! to what , my love , shall i compare thine eyne ? #amndbots

649:914 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

445:5 four days will quickly steep themselves in nights ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; #amndbots

135:178 by their increase , now knows not which is which : and this same progeny of evils comes #amndbots

445:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

31:840 well roared , lion . #amndbots

753:25 which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death ; according to our law immediately provided in that case . #amndbots

650:28 by him imprinted , and within his power to leave the figure , or disfigure it . @demetriusbot is a worthy gentleman . #amndbots

238:517 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

548:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

650:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

445:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

753:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

238:616 we will , fair queen , up to the mountain's top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction . #amndbots

32:43 i must confess that i have heard so much , and with @demetriusbot thought to have spoke thereof ; #amndbots

32:80 what is thisby ? a wandering knight ? #amndbots

445:273 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

135:680 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

342:644 but , like a sickness , did i loathe this food ; but , as in health , come to my natural taste , #amndbots

137:25 which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death ; according to our law immediately provided in that case . #amndbots

549:841 well run , thisbe . #amndbots

343:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

137:163 met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , by paved fountain , or by rushy brook , or on the beached margent of the sea , #amndbots

240:460 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

240:470 @lysanderbot , keep thy @hermiabot ; i will none : if e'er i lov'd her , all that love is gone . #amndbots

550:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

343:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

652:21 knacks , trifles , nosegays , sweetmeats , -- messengers of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth ; -- #amndbots

240:506 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

137:273 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

343:862 how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ? #amndbots

550:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

240:812 if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men . #amndbots

550:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

652:419 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

550:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

551:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

345:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

653:643 is only @helenashakebot . to her , my lord , was i betroth'd ere i saw @hermiabot : #amndbots

138:828 this is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ' the moon ? #amndbots

653:727 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

242:428 @titaniabot wak'd , and straightway lov'd an ass . #amndbots

756:895 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

654:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

449:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

553:416 while she was in her dull and sleeping hour , a crew of patches , rude mechanicals , #amndbots

758:438 so should the murder'd look ; and so should i , pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty : #amndbots

347:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

655:479 no , sir , she shall not , though you take her part . #amndbots

140:674 it is not possible : you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he . #amndbots

140:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

758:634 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

37:613 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

348:866 methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus : i hope she will be brief . #amndbots

348:892 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

39:46 for you , fair @hermiabot , look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will , #amndbots

142:342 ninus ' tomb , man : why , you must not speak that yet : that you answer to pyramus . you speak all your part at once , #amndbots

760:250 at our quaint spirits . sing me now asleep ; then to your offices , and let me rest . #amndbots

245:753 this fellow doth not stand upon points . #amndbots

760:286 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

349:113 mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse : for #amndbots

245:812 here come two noble beasts in , a moon and a lion . #amndbots

657:359 bless thee , @bottomshakebot ! bless thee ! thou art translated . #amndbots

760:359 bless thee , @bottomshakebot ! bless thee ! thou art translated . #amndbots

142:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

452:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

143:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

144:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

350:819 the very best at a beast , my lord , that e'er i saw . #amndbots

762:94 the joiner , you , the lion's part : -- and , i hope , here is a play fitted . #amndbots

350:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

557:165 therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea #amndbots

247:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

659:352 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

762:351 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

247:892 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

247:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

659:419 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

248:28 by him imprinted , and within his power to leave the figure , or disfigure it . @demetriusbot is a worthy gentleman . #amndbots

659:620 my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung #amndbots

557:701 ' tis strange , my @theseusshakebot , that these lovers speak of . #amndbots

146:156 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

660:904 will we sing , and bless this place . #amndbots

763:916 so , good night unto you all . give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends . #amndbots

764:7 go , @philostratebot , stir up the athenian youth to merriments ; awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth ; #amndbots

764:82 nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; i have a beard coming . #amndbots

250:95 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

354:512 up and down , up and down ; i will lead them up and down : i am fear'd in field and town . goblin , lead them up and down . #amndbots

44:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

457:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

251:390 nod to him , elves , and do him courtesies . #amndbots

765:842 well roared , lion . #amndbots

148:107 why , what you will . #amndbots

354:671 have you sent to @bottomshakebot's house ? is he come home yet ? #amndbots

251:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

458:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

148:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

45:134 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

767:318 ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a #amndbots

562:444 there is no following her in this fierce vein : here , therefore , for a while i will remain . #amndbots

562:546 that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown : jack shall have jill ; nought shall go ill ; #amndbots

767:552 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

459:571 i have a venturous fairy that shall seek the squirrel's hoard , and fetch thee new nuts . #amndbots

356:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

253:175 an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is , as in mockery , set : the spring , the summer , #amndbots

356:471 disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest , to thy peril , thou aby it dear . -- #amndbots

664:674 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

149:884 been a fine tragedy : and so it is , truly ; and very notably #amndbots

356:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

767:715 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

253:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

253:420 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

664:915 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

563:178 by their increase , now knows not which is which : and this same progeny of evils comes #amndbots

48:310 well , it shall be so . but there is two hard things ; that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber : for , you know , #amndbots

769:427 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

358:247 some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds ; some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings , #amndbots

255:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

255:50 of something nearly that concerns yourselves . #amndbots

666:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

666:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

151:746 let him approach . #amndbots

151:861 with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass . #amndbots

666:711 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

358:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

668:219 and here am i , and wode within this wood , because i cannot meet with @hermiabot . #amndbots

463:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

566:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

566:338 ay , marry , must you : for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again . #amndbots

256:827 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

50:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

153:613 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

257:32 know of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father's choice , #amndbots

463:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

772:115 devices known . in the meantime i will draw a bill of properties , such as our play wants . i pray you , fail me not . #amndbots

257:644 but , like a sickness , did i loathe this food ; but , as in health , come to my natural taste , #amndbots

464:176 the childing autumn , angry winter , change their wonted liveries ; and the maz'd world , #amndbots

567:186 would imitate ; and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise . #amndbots

669:183 and sat with me on neptune's yellow sands , marking the embarked traders on the flood ; #amndbots

568:270 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

568:273 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

568:423 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

259:29 in himself he is : but , in this kind , wanting your father's voice , the other must be held the worthier . #amndbots

362:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

155:747 let him approach . #amndbots

259:465 * awaking . * o helen , goddess , nymph , perfect , divine ! to what , my love , shall i compare thine eyne ? #amndbots

569:15 full of vexation come i , with complaint against my child , my daughter @hermiabot . -- #amndbots

466:63 marry , our play is -- the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisby . #amndbots

156:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

363:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

672:4 like to a step-dame or a dowager , long withering out a young man's revenue . #amndbots

467:37 take time to pause ; and by the next new moon , -- the sealing-day betwixt my love and me #amndbots

672:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

157:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

467:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

54:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

467:532 and dar'st not stand , nor look me in the face . where art thou ? #amndbots

570:533 and dar'st not stand , nor look me in the face . where art thou ? #amndbots

468:771 i wonder if the lion be to speak . #amndbots

262:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

469:131 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

674:422 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

263:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

263:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

675:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

367:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

573:728 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

573:732 i will hear that play ; for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it . #amndbots

367:680 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

161:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

675:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

471:164 to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind , but with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport . #amndbots

265:875 moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead . #amndbots

677:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

575:424 he murder cries , and help from athens calls . their sense thus weak , lost with their fears , thus strong , #amndbots

162:615 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

369:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

472:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

162:649 fair lovers , you are fortunately met : of this discourse we more will hear anon . -- @egeusbot , i will overbear your will ; #amndbots

472:479 no , sir , she shall not , though you take her part . #amndbots

162:677 it is not possible : you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he . #amndbots

472:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

677:550 come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , while i thy amiable cheeks do coy , #amndbots

266:141 thou speak'st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to @oberonbot , and make him smile , #amndbots

575:703 lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend #amndbots

678:684 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

164:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

61:178 from our debate , from our dissension : we are their parents and original . #amndbots

679:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

679:319 of moonshine . then there is another thing : we must have a wall in the great chamber ; for pyramus and thisby , says the #amndbots

577:320 story , did talk through the chink of a wall . #amndbots

782:329 speak , pyramus . -- thisby , stand forth . #amndbots

61:275 i charge thee , hence , and do not haunt me thus . #amndbots

577:387 the honey bags steal from the humble-bees , and , for nigh t-t apers , crop their waxen thighs , #amndbots

267:895 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

782:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

577:477 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

577:489 as this their jangling i esteem a sport . #amndbots

679:615 we will , fair queen , up to the mountain's top , and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction . #amndbots

679:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

269:292 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

784:114 if we meet in the city , we shall be dogg'd with company , and our #amndbots

579:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

63:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

579:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

476:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

63:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

166:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

167:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

64:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

374:682 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

580:888 a fortnight hold we this solemnity , in nightly revels and new jollity . #amndbots

64:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

478:22 with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart ; turned her obedience , which is due to me , #amndbots

64:865 methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus : i hope she will be brief . #amndbots

786:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

479:710 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

479:715 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

684:727 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

66:638 my lord , fair helen told me of their stealth , of this their purpose hither to this wood ; #amndbots

787:728 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

787:809 no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning . #amndbots

684:865 methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus : i hope she will be brief . #amndbots

170:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

479:892 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

66:819 the very best at a beast , my lord , that e'er i saw . #amndbots

66:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots
