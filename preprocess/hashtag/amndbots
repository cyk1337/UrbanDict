119:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

222:88 robin @starvelingbot , the tailor . #amndbots

324:114 if we meet in the city , we shall be dogg'd with company , and our #amndbots

529:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

222:156 come from the farthest steep of india , but that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , #amndbots

222:163 met we on hill , in dale , forest , or mead , by paved fountain , or by rushy brook , or on the beached margent of the sea , #amndbots

15:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

222:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

428:622 was never holla'd to , nor cheer'd with horn , in crete , in sparta , nor in thessaly . #amndbots

120:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

428:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

120:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

428:780 pyramus draws near the wall ; silence . #amndbots

325:901 first , rehearse your song by rote , to each word a warbling note ; hand in hand , with fairy grace , #amndbots

120:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

429:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

429:93 the joiner , you , the lion's part : -- and , i hope , here is a play fitted . #amndbots

429:110 some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . -- but , masters , here are your #amndbots

121:105 day ; a most lovely gentleman-like man ; therefore you must needs play pyramus . #amndbots

121:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

225:248 to make my small elves coats ; and some keep back the clamorous owl , that nightly hoots and wonders #amndbots

533:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

533:86 no , no , you must play pyramus ; and , @fluteshakebot , you thisby . #amndbots

19:42 and she is mine ; and all my right of her i do estate unto @demetriusbot . #amndbots

327:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

19:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

19:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

533:595 how came these things to pass ? o , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now ! #amndbots

533:617 such gallant chiding ; for , besides the groves , the skies , the fountains , every region near #amndbots

122:840 well roared , lion . #amndbots

430:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

431:40 relent , sweet @hermiabot ; -- and , @lysanderbot , yield thy crazed title to my certain right . #amndbots

431:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

328:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

431:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

431:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

124:574 sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms . fairies , be gone , and be all ways away . #amndbots

535:442 an if i could , what should i get therefore ? #amndbots

227:651 these things seem small and undistinguishable , like far-off mountains turned into clouds . #amndbots

124:705 one sees more devils than vast hell can hold ; that is the madman : the lover , all as frantic , #amndbots

21:481 take not her part ; for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her , thou shalt aby it . #amndbots

227:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

125:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

228:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

433:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

433:829 he dares not come there for the candle : for , you see , it is already in snuff . #amndbots

228:842 well shone , moon . -- truly , the moon shines with a good grace . #amndbots

228:860 no die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one . #amndbots

536:674 it is not possible : you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he . #amndbots

330:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

125:879 no epilogue , i pray you ; for your play needs no excuse . never excuse ; for when the players are all dead there #amndbots

229:3 another moon ; but , oh , methinks , how slow this old moon wanes ! she lingers my desires , #amndbots

434:5 four days will quickly steep themselves in nights ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; #amndbots

331:23 to stubborn harshness . -- and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace #amndbots

331:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

331:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

331:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

229:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

23:145 sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me ; then slip i from her bum , down topples she , #amndbots

331:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

435:598 music , ho ! music ; such as charmeth sleep . #amndbots

332:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

538:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

538:545 when thou wak'st , thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye : and the country proverb known , #amndbots

435:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

435:807 no remedy , my lord , when walls are so wilful to hear without warning . #amndbots

538:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

333:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

436:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

437:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

232:186 would imitate ; and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise . #amndbots

334:218 the one i'll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood , #amndbots

129:224 to trust the opportunity of night , and the ill counsel of a desert place , with the rich worth of your virginity . #amndbots

540:110 some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . -- but , masters , here are your #amndbots

232:295 well , we will have such a prologue ; and it shall be written in eight and six . #amndbots

26:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

232:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

232:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

334:755 his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . who is next ? #amndbots

129:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

334:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

438:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

336:41 scornful @lysanderbot ! true , he hath my love ; and what is mine my love shall render him ; #amndbots

439:60 here is the scroll of every man's name , which is thought fit , through all athens , to play in our interlude before the #amndbots

234:77 francis @fluteshakebot , the bellows-mender . #amndbots

131:188 and for her sake i will not part with him . #amndbots

28:34 chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon . thrice-blessed they that master so their blood #amndbots

28:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

439:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

234:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

439:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

336:737 the kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing . our sport shall be to take what they mistake : #amndbots

440:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

441:113 mile without the town , by moonlight ; there will we rehearse : for #amndbots

236:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

543:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

29:830 i am aweary of this moon : would he would change ! #amndbots

236:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

544:6 and then the moon , like to a silver bow new bent in heaven , shall behold the night of our solemnities . #amndbots

133:165 therefore the winds , piping to us in vain , as in revenge , have suck'd up from the sea #amndbots

338:191 and see our moonlight revels , go with us ; if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts . #amndbots

29:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

441:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

237:880 need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played #amndbots

134:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

443:5 four days will quickly steep themselves in nights ; four nights will quickly dream away the time ; #amndbots

545:772 no wonder , my lord : one lion may , when many asses do . #amndbots

340:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

546:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

443:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

238:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

443:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

136:424 he murder cries , and help from athens calls . their sense thus weak , lost with their fears , thus strong , #amndbots

444:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

33:536 by day's approach look to be visited . #amndbots

444:830 i am aweary of this moon : would he would change ! #amndbots

33:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

33:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

445:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

445:23 to stubborn harshness . -- and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace #amndbots

34:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

343:417 that work for bread upon athenian stalls , were met together to rehearse a play #amndbots

446:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

343:462 then will two at once woo one , -- that must needs be sport alone ; and those things do best please me #amndbots

549:445 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe ; #amndbots

138:625 this @helenashakebot , old nedar's @helenashakebot : i wonder of their being here together . #amndbots

343:653 why , then , we are awake : let's follow him ; and by the way let us recount our dreams . #amndbots

343:703 lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend #amndbots

446:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

138:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

138:712 more witnesseth than fancy's images , and grows to something of great constancy ; but , howsoever , strange and admirable . #amndbots

138:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

36:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

139:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

448:145 sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me ; then slip i from her bum , down topples she , #amndbots

550:914 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

140:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

37:175 an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is , as in mockery , set : the spring , the summer , #amndbots

37:181 set your heart at rest ; the fairy-land buys not the child of me . his mother was a vot'ress of my order : #amndbots

140:532 and dar'st not stand , nor look me in the face . where art thou ? #amndbots

345:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

345:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

448:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

552:641 melted as the snow -- seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gawd which in my childhood i did dote upon : #amndbots

552:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

142:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

347:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

245:677 you must say paragon : a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught . #amndbots

450:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

142:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

142:729 what are they that do play it ? #amndbots

553:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

554:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

451:474 if she cannot entreat , i can compel . #amndbots

143:477 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

246:535 now , go thy way . faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed . -- #amndbots

348:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

554:387 the honey bags steal from the humble-bees , and , for nigh t-t apers , crop their waxen thighs , #amndbots

143:625 this @helenashakebot , old nedar's @helenashakebot : i wonder of their being here together . #amndbots

451:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

143:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

349:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

144:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

144:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

144:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

349:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

452:727 merry and tragical ! tedious and brief ! that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow . #amndbots

555:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

349:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

248:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

350:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

453:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

42:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

350:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

145:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

454:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

454:724 when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ' the thrice three muses mourning for the death #amndbots

351:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

454:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

351:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

146:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

558:98 an you should do it too terribly , you would fright the duchess and the ladies , that they would shriek ; and that were #amndbots

455:282 pat , pat ; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal . this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn #amndbots

44:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

147:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

455:487 believe me , king of shadows , i mistook . did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ? #amndbots

456:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

353:645 now i do wish it , love it , long for it , and will for evermore be true to it . #amndbots

354:105 day ; a most lovely gentleman-like man ; therefore you must needs play pyramus . #amndbots

252:157 your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love , to @theseusshakebot must be wedded ; and you come #amndbots

354:172 no night is now with hymn or carol blest : -- therefore the moon , the governess of floods , #amndbots

149:166 contagious fogs ; which , falling in the land , hath every pelting river made so proud #amndbots

252:186 would imitate ; and sail upon the land , to fetch me trifles , and return again , as from a voyage , rich with merchandise . #amndbots

149:269 this is he , my master said , despised the athenian maid ; and here the maiden , sleeping sound , #amndbots

457:385 be kind and courteous to this gentleman ; hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes ; #amndbots

150:704 more than cool reason ever comprehends . the lunatic , the lover , and the poet are of imagination all compact : #amndbots

253:808 this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard . #amndbots

355:829 he dares not come there for the candle : for , you see , it is already in snuff . #amndbots

47:635 enough , enough , my lord ; you have enough ; i beg the law , the law upon his head . -- #amndbots

459:58 is all our company here ? #amndbots

356:79 @fluteshakebot , you must take thisby on you . #amndbots

561:892 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

459:141 thou speak'st aright ; i am that merry wanderer of the night . i jest to @oberonbot , and make him smile , #amndbots

254:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

459:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

562:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

357:731 i will hear that play ; for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it . #amndbots

563:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

255:845 and so comes pyramus . #amndbots

152:915 so , good night unto you all . give me your hands , if we be friends , and robin shall restore amends . #amndbots

153:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

153:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

256:358 bless thee , @bottomshakebot ! bless thee ! thou art translated . #amndbots

50:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

462:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

51:193 not for thy fairy kingdom . fairies , away : we shall chide downright if i longer stay . #amndbots

154:440 you spend your passion on a mispris'd mood : i am not guilty of @lysanderbot's blood ; #amndbots

462:531 abide me , if thou dar'st; for well i wot thou runn'st before me , shifting every place ; #amndbots

51:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

154:534 nay , then , thou mock'st me . thou shalt buy this dear , if ever i thy face by daylight see : #amndbots

154:566 what , wilt thou hear some music , my sweet love ? #amndbots

359:598 music , ho ! music ; such as charmeth sleep . #amndbots

359:676 yea , and the best person too : and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice . #amndbots

462:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

359:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

565:545 when thou wak'st , thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye : and the country proverb known , #amndbots

462:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

257:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

462:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

565:891 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

53:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

156:389 and pluck the wings from painted butterflies , to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes : #amndbots

361:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

53:222 tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit ; for i am sick when i do look on thee . #amndbots

259:480 you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services . let her alone : speak not of @helenashakebot ; #amndbots

567:318 lantern , and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person #amndbots

259:611 go , one of you , find out the forester ; -- for now our observation is perform'd; and since we have the vaward of the day , #amndbots

156:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

464:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

464:677 you must say paragon : a paramour is , god bless us , a thing of naught . #amndbots

54:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

466:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

363:325 when you have spoken your speech , enter into that brake ; and so every one according to his cue . #amndbots

466:368 i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note . so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; #amndbots

466:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

365:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

468:162 these are the forgeries of jealousy : and never , since the middle summer's spring , #amndbots

263:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

571:182 and , in the spiced indian air , by night , full often hath she gossip'd by my side ; #amndbots

263:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

571:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

263:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

365:730 and we will hear it . #amndbots

160:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

365:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

263:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

58:652 it seems to me that yet we sleep , we dream . -- do not you think the duke was here , and bid us follow him ? #amndbots

161:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

162:23 to stubborn harshness . -- and , my gracious duke , be it so she will not here before your grace #amndbots

573:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

265:349 i'll follow you ; i'll lead you about a round , through bog , through bush , through brake , through brier ; #amndbots

265:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

162:740 make periods in the midst of sentences , throttle their practis'd accent in their fears , #amndbots

163:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

369:70 a lover , that kills himself most gallantly for love . #amndbots

267:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

267:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

267:272 sleep his seat on thy eyelid : so awake when i am gone ; for i must now to @oberonbot . #amndbots

164:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

267:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

472:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

164:648 and , for the morning now is something worn , our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside . -- #amndbots

472:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

267:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

472:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

267:806 now is the mural down between the two neighbours . #amndbots

62:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

576:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

165:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

62:474 if she cannot entreat , i can compel . #amndbots

576:618 seem'd all one mutual cry : i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder . #amndbots

62:574 sleep thou , and i will wind thee in my arms . fairies , be gone , and be all ways away . #amndbots

370:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

474:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

474:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

577:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

269:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

269:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

371:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

577:612 my love shall hear the music of my hounds , -- uncouple in the western valley ; go : -- #amndbots

167:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

475:112 con them by to-morrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a #amndbots

577:902 will we sing , and bless this place . #amndbots

475:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

475:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

475:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

476:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

373:613 despatch , i say , and find the forester . -- #amndbots

271:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

476:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

271:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

476:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

476:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

373:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

579:639 and i in fury hither follow'd them , fair @helenashakebot in fancy following me . #amndbots

476:821 not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose . #amndbots

373:866 a mote will turn the balance , which pyramus , which thisbe , is the better . #amndbots

272:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

579:853 beshrew my heart , but i pity the man . #amndbots

477:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

272:513 here comes one . #amndbots

374:515 here , villain ; drawn and ready . where art thou ? #amndbots

477:540 yet but three ? come one more ; two of both kinds makes up four . here she comes , curst and sad : -- cupid is a knavish lad , #amndbots

272:546 that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown : jack shall have jill ; nought shall go ill ; #amndbots

170:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

273:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

67:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

478:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

273:653 why , then , we are awake : let's follow him ; and by the way let us recount our dreams . #amndbots

375:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

375:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

581:637 you of your wife , and me of my consent , -- of my consent that she should be your wife . #amndbots

581:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

582:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

274:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

479:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

172:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

583:442 an if i could , what should i get therefore ? #amndbots

275:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

275:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

172:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

378:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

173:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

481:462 then will two at once woo one , -- that must needs be sport alone ; and those things do best please me #amndbots

584:811 if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves , they may pass for excellent men . #amndbots

277:78 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

483:351 and neigh , and bark , and grunt , and roar , and burn , like horse , hound , hog , bear , fire , at every turn . #amndbots

278:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

278:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

175:627 but speak , @egeusbot ; is not this the day that @hermiabot should give answer of her choice ? #amndbots

278:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

380:710 it comprehends some bringer of that joy ; or in the night , imagining some fear , how easy is a bush supposed a bear ? #amndbots

278:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

483:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

483:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

380:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

586:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

73:540 yet but three ? come one more ; two of both kinds makes up four . here she comes , curst and sad : -- cupid is a knavish lad , #amndbots

176:897 to sweep the dust behind the door . #amndbots

382:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

485:616 i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bay'd the bear with hounds of sparta : never did i hear #amndbots

485:753 this fellow doth not stand upon points . #amndbots

485:828 this is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ' the moon ? #amndbots

75:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

383:914 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

487:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

384:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

487:342 ninus ' tomb , man : why , you must not speak that yet : that you answer to pyramus . you speak all your part at once , #amndbots

76:220 hence , get thee gone , and follow me no more . #amndbots

179:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

179:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

282:715 come now ; what masques , what dances shall we have , to wear away this long age of three hours #amndbots

179:746 let him approach . #amndbots

77:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

180:463 that befall preposterously . #amndbots

283:604 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

488:894 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

592:95 you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring . #amndbots

489:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

489:317 ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a #amndbots

181:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

386:707 doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; and as imagination bodies forth #amndbots

386:737 the kinder we , to give them thanks for nothing . our sport shall be to take what they mistake : #amndbots

592:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

387:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

185:22 with cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart ; turned her obedience , which is due to me , #amndbots

493:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

493:111 parts : and i am to entreat you , request you , and desire you , to #amndbots

82:243 fear not , my lord ; your servant shall do so . #amndbots

390:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

390:648 and , for the morning now is something worn , our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside . -- #amndbots

390:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

596:891 now the hungry lion roars , and the wolf behowls the moon ; whilst the heavy ploughman snores , #amndbots

83:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

83:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

494:427 and left sweet pyramus translated there : when in that moment , -- so it came to pass , -- #amndbots

186:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

83:472 look where thy love comes ; yonder is thy dear . #amndbots

83:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

83:608 with these mortals on the ground . #amndbots

494:832 stay the time . #amndbots

494:880 need none to be blamed . marry , if he that writ it had played #amndbots

187:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

392:646 fair lovers , you are fortunately met : of this discourse we more will hear anon . -- @egeusbot , i will overbear your will ; #amndbots

495:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

496:420 an ass's nowl i fixèd on his head ; anon , his thisbe must be answered , #amndbots

188:551 and stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head , and kiss thy fair large ears , my gentle joy . #amndbots

291:624 my lord , this is my daughter here asleep ; and this @lysanderbot ; this @demetriusbot is ; #amndbots

87:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

601:209 i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes . #amndbots

293:418 intended for great @theseusshakebot ' nuptial day . the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort #amndbots

293:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

499:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

88:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

603:531 abide me , if thou dar'st; for well i wot thou runn'st before me , shifting every place ; #amndbots

398:513 here comes one . #amndbots

193:516 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

197:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

505:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

300:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

505:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

608:671 have you sent to @bottomshakebot's house ? is he come home yet ? #amndbots

198:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

404:476 quick , come , -- #amndbots

199:739 to greet me with premeditated welcomes ; where i have seen them shiver and look pale , #amndbots

610:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

303:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

304:343 cues , and all . -- pyramus enter : your cue is past ; it is ' never tire . ' #amndbots

612:221 do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ? or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i cannot love you ? #amndbots

201:388 and light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes , to have my love to bed and to arise ; #amndbots

612:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

98:221 do i entice you ? do i speak you fair ? or , rather , do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not , nor i cannot love you ? #amndbots

614:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

99:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

614:95 you may do it extempore , for it is nothing but roaring . #amndbots

306:317 ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a #amndbots

511:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

614:646 fair lovers , you are fortunately met : of this discourse we more will hear anon . -- @egeusbot , i will overbear your will ; #amndbots

512:892 all with weary task fordone . now the wasted brands do glow , whilst the scritch-owl , scritching loud , #amndbots

205:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

410:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

513:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

410:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

410:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

205:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

616:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

616:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

206:34 chanting faint hymns to the cold , fruitless moon . thrice-blessed they that master so their blood #amndbots

103:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

206:328 what , a play toward ! i'll be an auditor ; an actor too perhaps , if i see cause . #amndbots

206:506 they wilfully exile themselves from light , and must for aye consort with black-brow'd night . #amndbots

412:15 full of vexation come i , with complaint against my child , my daughter @hermiabot . -- #amndbots

207:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

104:619 my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung #amndbots

515:887 this palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd the heavy gait of night . -- sweet friends , to bed . -- #amndbots

207:886 i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch'd . #amndbots

104:741 and , in conclusion , dumbly have broke off , not paying me a welcome . trust me , sweet , #amndbots

105:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

516:674 it is not possible : you have not a man in all athens able to discharge pyramus but he . #amndbots

311:821 not so , my lord ; for his valour cannot carry his discretion , and the fox carries the goose . #amndbots

105:628 it is , my lord . #amndbots

311:860 no die , but an ace , for him ; for he is but one . #amndbots

312:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

517:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

517:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

518:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

107:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

107:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

210:550 come , sit thee down upon this flowery bed , while i thy amiable cheeks do coy , #amndbots

210:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

416:712 more witnesseth than fancy's images , and grows to something of great constancy ; but , howsoever , strange and admirable . #amndbots

211:778 would you desire lime and hair to speak better ? #amndbots

315:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

315:143 in very likeness of a roasted crab ; and , when she drinks , against her lips i bob , #amndbots

108:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

315:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

315:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

5:845 and so comes pyramus . #amndbots

315:389 and pluck the wings from painted butterflies , to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes : #amndbots

109:174 the seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; and on old hyem's thin and icy crown #amndbots

623:295 well , we will have such a prologue ; and it shall be written in eight and six . #amndbots

212:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

110:533 come hither ; i am here . #amndbots

214:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

419:319 of moonshine . then there is another thing : we must have a wall in the great chamber ; for pyramus and thisby , says the #amndbots

419:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

419:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

626:544 on the ground sleep sound : i'll apply to your eye , gentle lover , remedy . * squeezing the juice on lysander's eye . * #amndbots

318:702 more strange than true . i never may believe these antique fables , nor these fairy toys . #amndbots

420:744 love , therefore , and tongue-tied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity . #amndbots

9:415 my mistress with a monster is in love . near to her close and consecrated bower , #amndbots

9:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

523:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

319:81 it is the lady that pyramus must love . #amndbots

112:835 why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . #amndbots

524:176 the childing autumn , angry winter , change their wonted liveries ; and the maz'd world , #amndbots

421:184 when we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive , and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind ; #amndbots

421:187 but she , being mortal , of that boy did die ; and for her sake do i rear up her boy : #amndbots

627:51 with duty and desire we follow you . #amndbots

114:2 now , fair @hippolytabot , our nuptial hour draws on apace ; four happy days bring in #amndbots

10:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

422:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

320:435 this is the woman , but not this the man . #amndbots

422:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

11:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

320:895 and we fairies , that do run by the triple hecate's team from the presence of the sun , following darkness like a dream , #amndbots

11:450 then fate o'er-rules , that , one man holding troth , a million fail , confounding oath on oath . #amndbots

321:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

423:66 answer , as i call you . -- nick @bottomshakebot , the weaver . #amndbots

526:77 francis @fluteshakebot , the bellows-mender . #amndbots

322:46 for you , fair @hermiabot , look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will , #amndbots

630:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

116:82 nay , faith , let not me play a woman ; i have a beard coming . #amndbots

12:881 pyramus , and hang'd himself in thisbe's garter , it would have #amndbots

527:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

527:810 it must be your imagination then , and not theirs . #amndbots

630:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

527:862 how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ? #amndbots

425:822 his discretion , i am sure , cannot carry his valour ; for the goose carries not the fox . it is well ; leave it to his #amndbots

631:716 between our after-supper and bed-time ? where is our usual manager of mirth ? what revels are in hand ? is there no play #amndbots

425:886 i fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn , as much as we this night have overwatch'd . #amndbots

529:14 thanks , good @egeusbot : what's the news with thee ? #amndbots

117:728 how shall we find the concord of this discord ? #amndbots

324:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

324:32 know of your youth , examine well your blood , whether , if you yield not to your father's choice , #amndbots

221:488 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

324:628 it is , my lord . #amndbots

118:428 @titaniabot wak'd , and straightway lov'd an ass . #amndbots

325:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

427:717 to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ? call @philostratebot . #amndbots

119:649 away with us to athens , three and three , we'll hold a feast in great solemnity . -- come , @hippolytabot . #amndbots

120:128 the king doth keep his revels here to-night ; take heed the queen come not within his sight . #amndbots

223:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

428:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

17:13 happy be @theseusshakebot , our renowned duke ! #amndbots

120:226 i will not stay thy questions ; let me go : or , if thou follow me , do not believe #amndbots

223:472 look where thy love comes ; yonder is thy dear . #amndbots

120:317 ay ; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a #amndbots

223:576 o , how i love thee ! how i dote on thee ! #amndbots

531:595 how came these things to pass ? o , how mine eyes do loathe his visage now ! #amndbots

121:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

429:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

429:647 for in the temple , by and by with us , these couples shall eternally be knit . #amndbots

532:684 i'll be hanged ; he would have deserved it : sixpence a-day in pyramus , or nothing . #amndbots

224:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

224:709 a local habitation and a name . such tricks hath strong imagination , that , if it would but apprehend some joy , #amndbots

327:732 go , bring them in : and take your places , ladies . #amndbots

327:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

430:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

430:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

225:131 and jealous @oberonbot would have the child knight of his train , to trace the forests wild : #amndbots

430:282 pat , pat ; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal . this green plot shall be our stage , this hawthorn #amndbots

18:830 i am aweary of this moon : would he would change ! #amndbots

328:375 out of this wood do not desire to go ; thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no . #amndbots

430:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

534:70 a lover , that kills himself most gallantly for love . #amndbots

329:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

123:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

534:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

329:755 his speech was like a tangled chain ; nothing impaired , but all disordered . who is next ? #amndbots

432:327 what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here , so near the cradle of the fairy queen ? #amndbots

331:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

228:620 with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like thessalian bulls ; #amndbots

536:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

228:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

433:738 and what poor duty cannot do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed #amndbots

228:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

331:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

229:19 thou hast by moonlight at her window sung , with feigning voice , verses of feigning love ; #amndbots

332:110 some of your french crowns have no hair at all , and then you will play bare-faced . -- but , masters , here are your #amndbots

332:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

229:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

229:217 i love thee not , therefore pursue me not . where is @lysanderbot and fair @hermiabot ? #amndbots

537:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

434:247 some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds ; some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings , #amndbots

434:373 thou art as wise as thou art beautiful . #amndbots

229:439 i had rather give his carcass to my hounds . #amndbots

126:246 come , now a roundel and a fairy song ; then , for the third part of a minute , hence ; #amndbots

434:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

434:724 when i from thebes came last a conqueror . ' the thrice three muses mourning for the death #amndbots

332:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

435:546 that every man should take his own , in your waking shall be shown : jack shall have jill ; nought shall go ill ; #amndbots

538:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

231:217 i love thee not , therefore pursue me not . where is @lysanderbot and fair @hermiabot ? #amndbots

539:368 i pray thee , gentle mortal , sing again ; mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note . so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape ; #amndbots

128:174 the seasons alter : hoary-headed frosts fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose ; and on old hyem's thin and icy crown #amndbots

25:11 with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . #amndbots

334:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

231:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

334:683 the duke had not given him sixpence a-day for playing pyramus , #amndbots

539:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

539:742 out of this silence yet i pick'd a welcome ; and in the modesty of fearful duty #amndbots

25:593 my @oberonbot ! what visions have i seen ! methought i was enamour'd of an ass . #amndbots

540:112 con them by to-morrow night ; and meet me in the palace wood , a #amndbots

437:168 the ploughman lost his sweat ; and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard : #amndbots

335:268 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

232:604 fairy king , attend and mark ; i do hear the morning lark . #amndbots

129:459 captain of our fairy band , @helenashakebot is here at hand , and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lover's fee ; #amndbots

232:675 no ; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens . #amndbots

129:515 here , villain ; drawn and ready . where art thou ? #amndbots

335:895 that the graves , all gaping wide , every one lets forth its sprite , in the church-way paths to glide : #amndbots

335:915 now to ' scape the serpent's tongue , we will make amends ere long ; else the @puckshakebot a liar call : #amndbots

438:842 well shone , moon . -- truly , the moon shines with a good grace . #amndbots

337:29 in himself he is : but , in this kind , wanting your father's voice , the other must be held the worthier . #amndbots

337:60 here is the scroll of every man's name , which is thought fit , through all athens , to play in our interlude before the #amndbots

542:107 why , what you will . #amndbots

130:828 this is the greatest error of all the rest : the man should be put into the lantern . how is it else the man i ' the moon ? #amndbots

439:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

543:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

543:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

440:771 i wonder if the lion be to speak . #amndbots

29:364 * waking . * what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ? #amndbots

339:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

544:432 that , when he wak'd , of force she must be ey'd . #amndbots

441:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

30:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

30:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

441:599 now when thou wak'st , with thine own fool's eyes peep . #amndbots

442:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

31:310 well , it shall be so . but there is two hard things ; that is , to bring the moonlight into a chamber : for , you know , #amndbots

545:820 true ; and a goose for his discretion . #amndbots

341:530 ho , ho , ho , ho ! coward , why com'st thou not ? #amndbots

239:438 yet you , the murderer , look as bright , as clear , as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere . #amndbots

33:90 robin @starvelingbot , you must play thisby's mother . -- tom @snoutshakebot , the tinker . #amndbots

547:535 now , go thy way . faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed . -- #amndbots

342:593 my @oberonbot ! what visions have i seen ! methought i was enamour'd of an ass . #amndbots

547:631 good-morrow , friends . saint valentine is past ; begin these wood-birds but to couple now ? #amndbots

547:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

444:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

239:723 tearing the thracian singer in their rage . ' that is an old device , and it was play'd #amndbots

547:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

548:89 here , peter @quincebot . #amndbots

343:130 a lovely boy , stol'n from an indian king ; she never had so sweet a changeling : #amndbots

343:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

548:335 a stranger pyramus than e'er played here ! #amndbots

33:912 while these visions did appear . and this weak and idle theme , no more yielding but a dream , gentles , do not reprehend ; #amndbots

343:425 made senseless things begin to do them wrong ; for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch ; #amndbots

241:338 ay , marry , must you : for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard , and is to come again . #amndbots

446:441 nor is he dead , for aught that i can tell . #amndbots

35:13 happy be @theseusshakebot , our renowned duke ! #amndbots

35:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

35:45 and come , @egeusbot ; you shall go with me ; i have some private schooling for you both . -- #amndbots

344:620 with ears that sweep away the morning dew ; crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like thessalian bulls ; #amndbots

138:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

550:30 rather your eyes must with his judgment look . #amndbots

242:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

345:134 but they do square ; that all their elves for fear creep into acorn cups , and hide them there . #amndbots

345:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

550:270 on the dank and dirty ground . pretty soul ! she durst not lie near this lack-love , this kill-courtesy . #amndbots

36:290 i believe we must leave the killing out , when all is done . #amndbots

243:156 come from the farthest steep of india , but that , forsooth , the bouncing amazon , #amndbots

448:169 the fold stands empty in the drowned field , and crows are fatted with the murrion flock ; #amndbots

243:185 which she , with pretty and with swimming gait following , -- her womb then rich with my young squire , -- #amndbots

140:80 what is thisby ? a wandering knight ? #amndbots

448:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

37:267 through the forest have i gone , but athenian found i none , on whose eyes i might approve #amndbots

346:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

37:431 i took him sleeping , -- that is finish'd too , -- and the athenian woman by his side ; #amndbots

140:896 now are frolic ; not a mouse shall disturb this hallow'd house : i am sent with broom before , #amndbots

244:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

449:350 sometime a horse i'll be , sometime a hound , a hog , a headless bear , sometime a fire ; #amndbots

347:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

245:44 but , being over-full of self-affairs , my mind did lose it . -- but , @demetriusbot , come ; #amndbots

245:48 to death , or to a vow of single life . -- come , my @hippolytabot : what cheer , my love ? #amndbots

142:7 go , @philostratebot , stir up the athenian youth to merriments ; awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth ; #amndbots

38:719 the lazy time , if not with some delight ? #amndbots

142:31 either to die the death , or to abjure for ever the society of men . therefore , fair @hermiabot , question your desires , #amndbots

142:38 for everlasting bond of fellowship , -- upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father's will ; #amndbots

38:861 with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass . #amndbots

39:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

245:629 go , bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns . #amndbots

142:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

245:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

450:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

451:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

349:268 this flower's force in stirring love . night and silence ! who is here ? weeds of athens he doth wear : #amndbots

451:772 no wonder , my lord : one lion may , when many asses do . #amndbots

451:823 discretion , and let us listen to the moon . #amndbots

143:621 slow in pursuit , but match'd in mouth like bells , each under each . a cry more tuneable #amndbots

451:863 she will find him by starlight . -- here she comes ; and her passion ends the play . #amndbots

451:881 pyramus , and hang'd himself in thisbe's garter , it would have #amndbots

246:885 the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve : -- lovers , to bed ; ' tis almost fairy time . #amndbots

143:708 the forms of things unknown , the poet's pen turns them to shapes , and gives to airy nothing #amndbots

247:17 stand forth , @lysanderbot ; -- and , my gracious duke , this man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child . #amndbots

452:44 but , being over-full of self-affairs , my mind did lose it . -- but , @demetriusbot , come ; #amndbots

143:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

40:913 if you pardon , we will mend . and , as i am an honest @puckshakebot , if we have unearned luck #amndbots

555:488 and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have ' nointed an athenian's eyes : and so far am i glad it so did sort , #amndbots

555:504 troop home to churchyards : damned spirits all , that in cross-ways and floods have burial , #amndbots

351:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

556:718 say , what abridgment have you for this evening ? what masque ? what music ? how shall we beguile #amndbots

248:726 ' a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe ; very tragical mirth . ' #amndbots

248:754 indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child on a recorder ; a sound , but not in government . #amndbots

556:809 the best in this kind are but shadows ; and the worst are no worse , if imagination amend them . #amndbots

453:879 no epilogue , i pray you ; for your play needs no excuse . never excuse ; for when the players are all dead there #amndbots

455:445 so sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe ; #amndbots

353:478 i would i had your bond ; for i perceive a weak bond holds you ; i'll not trust your word . #amndbots

250:624 my lord , this is my daughter here asleep ; and this @lysanderbot ; this @demetriusbot is ; #amndbots

455:673 if he come not , then the play is marred ; it goes not forward , doth it ? #amndbots

251:144 and on her withered dewlap pour the ale . the wisest aunt , telling the saddest tale , #amndbots

559:426 some sleeves , some hats : from yielders all things catch . i led them on in this distracted fear , #amndbots

559:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

559:522 and wilt not come ? come , recreant ; come , thou child ; i'll whip thee with a rod : he is defiled #amndbots

45:171 for lack of tread , are undistinguishable : the human mortals want their winter here ; #amndbots

457:471 disparage not the faith thou dost not know , lest , to thy peril , thou aby it dear . -- #amndbots

355:477 no , no , sir : -- he will seem to break loose ; take on as you would follow : but yet come not . you are a tame man ; go ! #amndbots

560:681 o sweet bully @bottomshakebot ! thus hath he lost sixpence a day #amndbots

560:806 now is the mural down between the two neighbours . #amndbots

46:503 and yonder shines aurora's harbinger , at whose approach ghosts , wandering here and there , #amndbots

253:271 churl , upon thy eyes i throw all the power this charm doth owe ; when thou wak'st let love forbid #amndbots

150:142 when i a fat and bean-fed horse beguile , neighing in likeness of a filly foal ; and sometime lurk i in a gossip's bowl , #amndbots

458:422 or russet-pated choughs , many in sort , rising and cawing at the gun's report , sever themselves and madly sweep the sky , #amndbots

356:460 shall we their fond pageant see ? lord , what fools these mortals be ! #amndbots

254:190 perchance till after @theseusshakebot ' wedding-day . if you will patiently dance in our round , #amndbots

151:94 have you the lion's part written ? pray you , if it be , give it me , for i am slow of study . #amndbots

47:825 he should have worn the horns on his head . #amndbots

151:155 playing on pipes of corn , and versing love to amorous phillida . why art thou here , #amndbots

48:4 like to a step-dame or a dowager , long withering out a young man's revenue . #amndbots

459:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

562:706 sees helen's beauty in a brow of egypt : the poet's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , #amndbots

254:703 lovers and madmen have such seething brains , such shaping fantasies , that apprehend #amndbots

562:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

460:121 how now , spirit ! whither wander you ? #amndbots

358:147 and waxen in their mirth , and neeze , and swear a merrier hour was never wasted there . -- #amndbots

563:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

359:171 for lack of tread , are undistinguishable : the human mortals want their winter here ; #amndbots

461:190 perchance till after @theseusshakebot ' wedding-day . if you will patiently dance in our round , #amndbots

153:11 with pomp , with triumph , and with revelling . #amndbots

49:714 here come the lovers , full of joy and mirth . -- joy , gentle friends ! joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts ! #amndbots

49:787 the wall , methinks , being sensible , should curse again . #amndbots

564:633 i pray you all , stand up . i know you two are rival enemies ; how comes this gentle concord in the world , #amndbots

461:682 during his life ; he could not have ' scaped sixpence a-day ; an #amndbots

153:505 already to their wormy beds are gone ; for fear lest day should look their shames upon #amndbots

153:636 they would have stol'n away , they would , @demetriusbot , thereby to have defeated you and me : #amndbots

153:651 these things seem small and undistinguishable , like far-off mountains turned into clouds . #amndbots

462:83 that's all one ; you shall play it in a mask , and you may speak as small as you will . #amndbots

360:146 and ' tailor ' cries , and falls into a cough ; and then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe , #amndbots

153:911 if we shadows have offended , think but this , -- and all is mended , -- that you have but slumber'd here #amndbots

154:129 for @oberonbot is passing fell and wrath , because that she , as her attendant , hath #amndbots

154:133 and now they never meet in grove or green , by fountain clear , or spangled starlight sheen , #amndbots

360:672 he cannot be heard of . out of doubt , he is transported . #amndbots

360:679 masters , the duke is coming from the temple ; and there is #amndbots

463:285 what sayest thou , bully @bottomshakebot ? #amndbots

566:711 but all the story of the night told over , and all their minds transfigur'd so together , #amndbots

566:835 why , all these should be in the lantern ; for all these are in the moon . but silence ; here comes thisbe . #amndbots

566:893 puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud . now it is the time of night #amndbots

155:687 @bottomshakebot ! -- o most courageous day ! o most happy hour ! #amndbots

156:738 and what poor duty cannot do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed #amndbots

465:45 and come , @egeusbot ; you shall go with me ; i have some private schooling for you both . -- #amndbots

260:435 this is the woman , but not this the man . #amndbots

260:516 follow me , then , to plainer ground . #amndbots

260:568 or say , sweet love , what thou desirest to eat . #amndbots

54:191 and see our moonlight revels , go with us ; if not , shun me , and i will spare your haunts . #amndbots

157:468 when thou hold'st up thy hand : o , let me kiss this princess of pure white , this seal of bliss ! #amndbots

465:680 two or three lords and ladies more married : if our sport had gone forward , we had all been made men . #amndbots

54:232 ay , there it is . #amndbots

363:687 @bottomshakebot ! -- o most courageous day ! o most happy hour ! #amndbots

466:24 consent to marry with @demetriusbot , i beg the ancient privilege of athens , -- as she is mine i may dispose of her : #amndbots

466:613 despatch , i say , and find the forester . -- #amndbots

466:619 my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , so flew'd , so sanded ; and their heads are hung #amndbots

466:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

364:743 i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence . #amndbots

262:512 up and down , up and down ; i will lead them up and down : i am fear'd in field and town . goblin , lead them up and down . #amndbots

365:525 follow my voice ; we'll try no manhood here . #amndbots

57:43 i must confess that i have heard so much , and with @demetriusbot thought to have spoke thereof ; #amndbots

468:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

263:623 judge when you hear . -- but , soft , what nymphs are these ? #amndbots

366:723 tearing the thracian singer in their rage . ' that is an old device , and it was play'd #amndbots

263:721 * reads . * ' the battle with the centaurs , to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp . ' #amndbots

263:725 of learning , late deceas'd in beggary . ' that is some satire , keen and critical , not sorting with a nuptial ceremony . #amndbots

263:738 and what poor duty cannot do , noble respect takes it in might , not merit . where i have come , great clerks have purposed #amndbots

367:148 but room , fairy , here comes @oberonbot . #amndbots

160:896 now are frolic ; not a mouse shall disturb this hallow'd house : i am sent with broom before , #amndbots

161:178 from our debate , from our dissension : we are their parents and original . #amndbots

572:421 and forth my mimic comes . when they him spy , as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye , #amndbots

161:218 the one i'll slay , the other slayeth me . thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood , #amndbots

367:437 so should the murder'd look ; and so should i , pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty : #amndbots

264:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

162:49 @demetriusbot , and @egeusbot , go along ; i must employ you in some business against our nuptial , and confer with you #amndbots

573:524 yea , art thou there ? #amndbots

265:618 seem'd all one mutual cry : i never heard so musical a discord , such sweet thunder . #amndbots

265:626 no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may ; and , hearing our intent , came here in grace of our solemnity . -- #amndbots

162:475 i say i love thee more than he can do . #amndbots

59:298 i fear it , i promise you . #amndbots

59:513 here comes one . #amndbots

59:547 the man shall have his mare again , and all shall be well . #amndbots

266:132 but she perforce withholds the loved boy , crowns him with flowers , and makes him all her joy : #amndbots

266:819 the very best at a beast , my lord , that e'er i saw . #amndbots

60:419 who pyramus presented in their sport , forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake ; when i did him at this advantage take , #amndbots

370:46 for you , fair @hermiabot , look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will , #amndbots

163:820 true ; and a goose for his discretion . #amndbots

163:831 it appears , by his small light of discretion , that he is in the wane : but yet , in courtesy , in all reason , we must #amndbots

164:37 take time to pause ; and by the next new moon , -- the sealing-day betwixt my love and me #amndbots
