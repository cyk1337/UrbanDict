rt @_snape_ : did russia hack the oscars ? #oscars

rt @altnoaa : if only elections could be like the #oscars

so i guess steve harvey is off the hook . #oscars

rt @itsadamjsmith : a movie about a young gay black boy just won best picture in trump's america . #oscars

rt @theellenshow : asghar farhadi missed accepting an oscar to make an important point . and i support him . #oscars

rt @realdonaldtrump : this is amateur night - who the hell is in charge of this production ? #oscars

i didn't know steve harvey was hosting #oscars

rt @hasief : so this is what the ending of la la land feels like in real life . #oscars

that was cruel and unusual punishment . la la land didn't deserve best picture but it also didn't deserve public humiliation . #oscars
