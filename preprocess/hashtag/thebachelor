" let me ask you this . are you ready to quit ? " - chris harrison " i dare you . " - america #thebachelor

him checking out would be the best thing for everyone but corrine to be honest #thebachelor

that was a bit too dramatic . he's just going to say something like " let's get out of here and go to ... " #thebachelor

rt @bachbros : having that classic sinking feeling that nothing is going to happen for the first 3/4 of this episode . #thebachelor

can the girls just all make out ? they all love each other so much . #thebachelor

i feel like most of these girls are just here for the vacation and gorgeous islands . üòÇ #thebachelor

i'll say this : it takes real courage to stick with a group of beautiful women and travel the world . #thebachelor

nick is so brave to give these too-good-for-him-anyway ladies a shot so brave #thebachelor

yo we gotta get corrine to hometowns . that will be fantastic television . #thebachelor

corinne is definitely getting a reality show out of this . i wonder which channel her daddy will go to for it ... #thebachelor

i have heard corinne say " my vagine is platinum " entirely too many times this season #thebachelor

nicks shorts keep getting shorter #thebachelor

excuse me vanessa ?? you've never been on a boat before ...? #thebachelor

rt @leahpettegrew : if nick cries one more time i'll finally boycott his season #thebachelor

i love vanessa and nick together !! ‚ù§ #thebachelor

i told you not to do it ! ahahahahaha ! #thebachelor

i straight up thought nick was gonna pull a ben and tell vanessa he loved her . but in other news , vanessa is pissed #thebachelor

nick wants to feel like he's saying i love you for the first time ... so someone delete all that footage from past seasons . #thebachelor

nick trying so hard not to look at vanessa's boobs while she is pouring her heart out . #thebachelor

the vanessa was just the falcons at the super bowl and she just blew her 25-point lead #thebachelor

vanessa , he's prob not allowed to tell you how he feels . ben higgins ruined things for all future bachelors/bachelorettes . #thebachelor

rt @marissad415 : there's no better way to spend galentine's day than watching women compete for a man on #thebachelor

this zales commercial is better than this whole season of #thebachelor

i hope corinne makes it to hometowns and raquel makes her cheesy pasta for the family dinner #thebachelor

cob's gonna slob on nick's knob like it's her job < - only a bit more obscene than the vagine line getting plays on network tv #thebachelor

rt @bachelorburnbk : yesssss . corinne needs to get a hometown date . because like , raquel and cheese pasta is life . #thebachelor

wait , there's a kristina on this show ? well , we know who's about to get eliminated ! #thebachelor

maybe that's nicks way of saying goodbye corrine bye üëã #thebachelor

3 on 1 - throw down between corrine who grew up with a nanny and a russian who ate lipstick growing up #thebachelor

those sharks are too small to go after anyone they need to calm down . #thebachelor

" are they toothless ? " ü¶àü¶àü¶à favorite quote by corinne üòÇüòÇ #thebachelor
