i feel like most of these girls are just here for the vacation and gorgeous islands . üòÇ #thebachelor

i'll say this : it takes real courage to stick with a group of beautiful women and travel the world . #thebachelor

nick wants to feel like he's saying i love you for the first time ... so someone delete all that footage from past seasons . #thebachelor

nick trying so hard not to look at vanessa's boobs while she is pouring her heart out . #thebachelor

the vanessa was just the falcons at the super bowl and she just blew her 25-point lead #thebachelor

vanessa , he's prob not allowed to tell you how he feels . ben higgins ruined things for all future bachelors/bachelorettes . #thebachelor

cob's gonna slob on nick's knob like it's her job < - only a bit more obscene than the vagine line getting plays on network tv #thebachelor

rt @bachelorburnbk : yesssss . corinne needs to get a hometown date . because like , raquel and cheese pasta is life . #thebachelor

rt @divegirl0808 : what no cheese pasta ? #thebachelor

rt @pattimurin : nick just spit his olive into his napkin . #thebachelor

rt @princessprobz : oh my gosh i love raquel already #thebachelor

rt @princessprobz : " i couldn't do a lot of things without her ... like pour my own wine . " #thebachelor

" i couldn't do a lot of things without her " - corinne's mom with perfect timing as raquel slides in handing her a wine glass #thebachelor

rt @princessprobz : " i couldn't do a lot of things without her ... like pour my own wine . " #thebachelor

rt @seanlowe09 : something tells me it's not going to work out with nick and rachel . #thebachelor

rt @bach_shitcray : raquel for president . #thebachelor

tbh it's not weird that corinne has a nanny . it's just the way she talks about her #thebachelor

rt @princessprobz : corinne's first move when he dumps her is to call amex to dispute that charge . #thebachelor

rt @maeseal2 : can we just fast forward to @ravengates09 and @lukepell meeting post bachelor and falling in love ?! #thebachelor

this raquel-nick alone time is such an important dynamic . #thebachelor

it's all about money for them . #thebachelor

corinne doesn't know what nick does . #thebachelor

rt @jennalcrowley : nick having a heart to heart with raquel is the best part of this entire season . #thebachelor

corinne's dad seems pretty cool , not gonna lie #thebachelor

raquel is the equivalent of dorota , who was blair's nanny on gossip girl . #thebachelor

do you have a job nick ? #thebachelor

rt @brittcorcoran88 : when the platinum vagine didn't work corrine pulled out the platinum visa . #thebachelor

this money talk is v awk #thebachelor

i kinda think the reason we don't know what this " multi-million dollar company " is is because it's a mafia front . #thebachelor

corrine's family is tough ... daddy how are you gonna support my daughter ? raquel tu quieres cash me ousside ? #thebachelor

poor nick , now he's the peasant ?!? üòÇ #thebachelor

thank god corinne's mom at least realizes her daughter is looney . #thebachelor

rt @justin_biegel : raquel asking the tough questions #thebachelor

my mom just pointed out that throughout the entire season corinne's hair has looked like a rat's nest #thebachelor

rt @bachelorburnbk : pretty sure corinne did not come on this show wanting to win and now she has no clue what to do . #thebachelor

corrine's day is definitely a simpsons character . specifically one that you would find at moe's tavern . #thebachelor

rt @bachelorburnbk : what the shit is this meal , raquel ? where's the cheese pasta ? #thebachelor

rt @barstoolchief : can't wait to see raquel on bachelor in paradise #thebachelor

rt @seanlowe09 : raquel is very normal and not funny . i'm pretty disappointed . #thebachelor

corrine's dad is so cute & was sweet trying to be accepting about nick ; but he may have unintentionally emasculated him . üò≥üåπ #thebachelor

rt @bachelorburnbk : pretty sure corinne did not come on this show wanting to win and now she has no clue what to do . #thebachelor

" i think corinne is the lid to nick's pot . " that just happened . and he was serious . #thebachelor

i actually like corrine more now ... #thebachelor

i want corrine to win so bad . mainly because nick doesn't deserve the other three . #thebachelor

mom : * talking abt corrine * what kind of psycho medicine is she on #thebachelor

rt @seminolegirl97 : the entire family conversation is about affording corrine not loving her . run men , run ! üèÉ #thebachelor

corrine is about to trump this whole thing . i feel it in bones . #thebachelor

rt @breannewagnon : corinne loves to eat , sleep , drink , and shop . i need to be her friend üòÇ #thebachelor

rt @princessprobz : how are they not having cheese pasta right now ? #thebachelor

corinne might win .... and that makes me sad #thebachelor

rt @pjpass17 : raquel will be a greater breadwinner than nick #thebachelor

when rachel took nick to her all black church as her first stop before taking him home i was worried for him , but he fit rt in . #thebachelor

rt @seanlowe09 : props to rachel for putting her faith front and center . #thebachelor

" we've been dating for a month & a half " yea ok corrinne hes been dating everyone else for that long just stopüòÇüòÇüíÄ #thebachelor

rt @sarahmmimms : corrine's dad put ice in a " 15-year single malt " . this is the most upsetting thing so far #thebachelor

can we just skip vanessa ? oh you're " re-evaluating " your relationship again ?! let's just not . sorry not sorry , you're annoying . #thebachelor

rt @lolbachelor : jim asking if corrine's okay being the breadwinner is code for " will i have to support this guy too " , right ? #thebachelor

pretty heated there was no cheese pasta at corinne's hometown . #thebachelor

no way corrine thinks nick can support her . #thebachelor

if corrine thinks it's " icky " that 3 other women are dating nick , just wait until the fantasy suites #thebachelor

did not tweet about corrines hometown , i was making a mugcake . now i'm back , let's go ! #thebachelor

i just love raven and that she's beautiful inside and out #thebachelor

goodbye to corinne tonight . #thebachelor

you know it's serious when chris is escorting the girls to the rose ceremony personally #thebachelor

andy don't you dare be rude ! #thebachelor

we all know rachel goes home tonight so can we skip this damn rose ceremony and andi convo ? #thebachelor

i'm more interested in why andi's in leather pants . #thebachelor

andi can go ahead and leave now she's like 3 seasons late #thebachelor

gone with the wind fabulous . #thebachelor

rt @jtrain56 : andi dorfman is brought to you tonight by mortgage payments . #thebachelor

frankly , i'm offended that abc thinks we care about or we're remotely concerned about this convo with andi üò¥ #thebachelor

having andi on this season makes about as much sense as a 23 year old having a nanny . #thebachelor

it takes more than just being the last one standing to get engaged . üëèüèºüëèüèº #thebachelor

is it wrong that i'm totally with nick on not getting engaged just because 1 girl is left ? why rush ? #thebachelor

andi is here to advise nick on the title of his book . #thebachelor

it's 9 minutes in and it's already intense . #thebachelor

rt @darcwhale : raven ... what ?!?! youve never had a .. what ?! i hope someone is dragging tf out of her cheating ex rn holy wow #thebachelor

the only reason we can have this open conversation about sex on this show is because kaitlyn was bullied relentlessly for it #thebachelor

raven ... what ??!! not sure he's the one to help with that ... hold out for a real man !! #thebachelor

never had an orgasm ? guuuuuurl i'm so sorry . #thebachelor

raven seriously has the best comments out of left field . #thebachelor

i don't understand why they gotta be all out in the cold like that ? #thebachelor

rt @full_of_moxie : raven admitting she's never had an o did more damage to that cheating doctor than that stiletto ever did #thebachelor

words that should never be said on tv : any of those " four letter words " , orgasm ... #thebachelor

why do they always have the women standing up in the cold #thebachelor

rt @good_kompany : raven has never had an orgasm . her ex boyfriends must be hiding behind the couch right now . #thebachelor

what's more astonishing : that raven has never had an orgasm or that she is comfortable announcing that on national television ? #thebachelor

tbh a windy night in brooklyn ( in a dress ) sounds awful . i'd bounce from that rose ceremony real quick #thebachelor

now that i know raven's never had an orgasm , i don't really blame her for beating her ex mans with a shoe . #thebachelor

i'm still not ready for corrine to go home #thebachelor
