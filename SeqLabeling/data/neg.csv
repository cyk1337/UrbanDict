2565491	emo	"unlike the many different opininated definition of EMO out there the correct one is EMOTIVE hardcore. ""Emotive Hardcore"" music genre began to flourish in the late 80s, led by bands such as the likes of Rites of Spring. The term Emo was, believe it or not, a somewhat derogatory term used to put down fans of the new wave ""Emotive Hardcore"" bands. But, after a huge boom from the genre over the last decade and a bit, the term has been stolen by ""stupid little boys who cry and wear eyeliner,"" as quoted from an article on barb wire so eloquently puts it. Now many teens who have never even heard of the word emotive or listened to real Emo music, claim ""Emo"" as their own. so basically any so called ""emo"" has based there lifestyle on a farce when most dont even know what that kind of music is.It is just another stupid trend for people to be apart and excluded from. A ""click"" in otherswords they the ""EMO kids phase"" who believe themselves to be original when its obviously people just trying to fit in by following the trends like the sheep they are... Not following a trend that doesn't suit you means you are strong and aware of who you are. That's why only young teens are emo, they have no idea what's going on, or how lucky they are, they are insecure and have no self confidence, and so they fit in by not fitting in... it's a joke, but most grow out of it... but basically its foolish to become something you don't even understand in the forst place so well done to all you emos out there well smart arent you being part of something so trivial.Oh and another thing about it bands such as MCR P!ATD and FOB are not in the emotive hardcore genre To be perfectly honest no actually emotive hardcore band exists today. Funny don't you think?"

2623340	God	God is a being which, in its various incarnations, has been directly responsible for more human suffering than any other despot or dictator in the history of the human race. Many mistakenly attribute the creation of the universe to this entity. However, this is not accurate. At best, God was smoking a reefer when things got started up - at worst, God doesn't exist. More wars and irrational slaughtering have occurred in the name of God than in any other name. All said, the death-toll is believed to be at least, in collective, the total population of the Earth as it stands today. Prayer is an act typically directed at God. However, there is no statistical correlation between prayer and the desired outcomes asked for in prayer. Therefore, if God does exist, it's statistically proven that it doesn't care for the plight of man. The concept of God, in the west, is largely associated with Abrahamic faiths, namely Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. These faiths are also the three major monotheistic belief systems of the word and are each, in their own regards spreading a dangerous meme in which God is portrayed as kind, good and merciful. God is none of these things. Historically, according to the old testament, God is a petty and jealous being. These are the earliest records of existence and concept of God. Religions that lack a God tend to be more objective and peaceful. For an example, see Buddhism.

This fandom is based solely on Orihime's unrequirited feelings towards ichigo.In fact half of the fans tend to base their arguments in the size of Orihime's breasts and the fact that she and Ichigo have orange hair, they also over react to any scene where Ichigo shows some kind of affection towards Orihime even if it's the same kind of affection he holds for his other friends like Ishida or Chad.Also lately the Ichihime fans have started with what I believe is the dumbest way of making their fave pairing look better, which is to Bash Ichiruki with an argument that it causes super-herpes which is only a lame way to say Ichihime is good (but it isn't) In the end even if Ichiruki does not become canon (because in the end bleach is a shonen) it will always be more possible to happen that Ichihime because Ichigo doesn't have romantic feelings towards Orihime nor has he hinted so, and despite the fact that he fights so much with Rukia he's said several times that she changed his world and is shown to be more desperate and concerned about her than he is about other characters whenever she's hurt or in danger. Orihime doesn't love him completelyHalf the people who like Ichihime are crybabies who don't really seem to be able to handle the truth and go on and on about how Ichiruki shippers or people with common sense badmouth them.
