" sikhs are those who are disciples to the guru . sikhism originated in the punjab region of northwest india , where it drew on elements from bhakti hinduism and islamic sufism to develop into a distinctive religious tradition in its own right . sikhs believe that liberation from the karmic cycle of rebirths occurs in the merging of the human spirit with the all - embracing spirit of god . their religious worship involves contemplation of the divine name . the ultimate deity is known by several names : sat ( truth ) , sat guru ( true guru ) , akal purakh ( timeless being ) , kartar ( creator ) , and wahi - guru ( " praise to the guru " ) . by concentrating on god 's name ( or many titles ) , one conquers the ego and unites with god . known as the " religion of the householder , " sikhism emphasizes the family and advocates living in the world without being worldly . moral purity is considered the chief basis of religion . there is no priesthood per se , but there are official readers of scripture . the 10th guru , guru gobind singh , instituted the khalsa brotherhood , in which initiates are required to wear five distinctive symbols : uncut hair , a comb , a steel wrist bangle , a sword , and short underpants . not all sikhs belong to this disciplined fellowship , but many do obey the principle rules of khalsa . guru gobind singh also required all male sikhs to take the name singh ( meaning " lion " ) and all female sikhs to take the name kaur ( " princess " ) . these measures give sikhs a strong sense of communal identity , symbolized by the characteristic turbans and beards worn by sikh men .

1752048	Classical	classical 	 the word " classical (I, 0.9029) " as applied to music has two meanings . the narrow meaning is the music that predominated in cultivated circles from about 1759 or so ( the year handel died ) through about 1827 ( the year beethoven died ) . the most prominent classical composers were haydn , mozart , and beethoven , though there were many others as well -- among them j.s . bach 's sons , esp . c.p.e . bach , johann nepomuk hummel , luigi boccherini , karl ditters von dittersdorf.and many others . of course , this time classification is a bit arbitrary ; schubert , who died a scant 20 months after beethoven , is generally considered a romantic composer , though many of his longer works from all but the last few years of his life are basically classical in the narrow sense . in the broader sense , classical music is more difficult to define precisely ; you can find exceptions to almost any generalizations you make . yes , classical music tends to be in longer forms that popular music , but a great many classical composers have written songs which are no longer that the average pop song . there is even an australian composer named myroslav gutej whose 3 movenment piano sonata # 7 lasts a total of 24 seconds ! yes , classical music tends to be " serious " music ; in fact , many have adopted the term " serious music " in lieu of classical music , because they think it more accurate . but that does not mean that all non - classical music is not serious , or that no classical music has humor . many operas have comic plots ; probably about half of opera plots involve crossdressing by at least one character . and brahms academic festival overture , written , as you might expect , to celebrate a particular academic festival , horrified many of the academics and delighted their students because it was based on four popular german student drinking songs . much of the humor of j.s . bach is lost to us now , because much of his music , including his sacred cantatas and organ music , incorporated melodies from the popular music of his day ; this often shocked many members of the congregation . at the other end , the song " strange fruit , " popularized by billie holiday , certainly qualifies as " serious " music . and finally , whether a composer is considered classical or popular can be a rather arbirary , individual decision at the margins . i have made the decision , for example , to include all of duke ellington , even his longer symphonic compositions , in with my jazz section . otoh , i categorize both george gershwin and scott joplin ( not just his opera treemonisha ) as classical composers . and while i think rap is an abomination , i must say that many people who began as rap " artists " have turned out to be people of real artistic depth in music and movies . queen latifah is one of the few who has branched out into other kinds of music , but others , like ice t and will smith have shown themselves to be fine actors with genuine depth . and , divorced from its often obscene , violent , and mysogynistic content , rap as a form , if not a name , has been around for a long time , going back at least as far as the gilbert and sullivan patter songs . and give another listen to pete seeger 's " talking atom " from the late 40 's , if you have never heard it .

" but she made a typo when she typed " window " ... she actually typed " windwow " . in fact that was the only mistake she made in typing up the entire thing . this was like the fourth time she had typed it in because i complained about other typos in previous drafts . so when i complained about " windwow " , she grabbed it and put a line through the second " w " and gave it back to me , and that 's when i realized that she was n't going to type it in a fifth time . i think it was at that very moment when i ceased in being a perfectionist . anyway , since that fateful day , whenever i wrote the words " window " or " windows " , i intentionally spelled it " windwow " or " windwows " instead . this is especially noteworthy since i now work as a columnist for a computer magazine and have to write things about microsoft windwows a lot . it drives my editor crazy .

2562493	chav	chavi chatham 	 the chav ( or lamo inferior ) is a sub species of baboon which has somehow learned to do a feeble imitation of the english language and live among the british as parasites . the origins of the word chav are unclear . opinion is divided as to whether the word is a corruption of the romany word " chavi (I, 0.9335) " , ( roughly translating as " child " ) or an abbreviation of the word " chatham (I, 0.9335) , " a town , like many in southeast england , with an inordinately high proportion of these creatures . the chavs themselves are thought by many to be the result of some sort of bio - terrorism or the accidental release of biohazardous materials from a research facility located near a mcdonalds " restaurant . " the females ( or " chavettes " ) can be identified by absurdly large hoop earrings and incredibly tight scraped - back ponytail hairstyle . the male is the same size as the female but tends to wear tracksuits with hood up in all weathers or pink / powder blue / hooped polo shirts with collars turned up . renowned for cowardice , aggression , and a tendency to breed like the head lice they keep as pets ( along with staffordshire bull terriers . ) the mating habits of the chav revolve around the males driving around urban areas in small , cheap cars filled with sub - woofers blaring out repetitive random noise and hooting sounds . this mating call can be heard for many kilometres . the unfeasably large hoop earrings on the females vibrate and jangle in response to this noise , letting them know that a potential mate is somewhere in the vicinity . the chav is a highly territorial beast . like most lower primates , getting too close or making eye contact is hazardous and often results in them attacking you . although they are physically weak , they always attack en masse often using some form of crude tool for bludgeoning or cutting . in smaller groups they are only likely to attack if they sense fear / weakness or if you turn your back on them . they tend to congregate in huge groups , very much like the gelada baboon , their closest relative . this phenomenon is most commonly seen in shopping malls , fast food restaurants , city / town centres , spanish / mediterranean budget holiday destinations and cheaper forms of public transport . for some reason , chavs are a protected species in the uk and are never culled and only rarely incarcerated by the authorities . fortunately , there are many citizens action groups trying to rectify this situation . the only people known to like chavs are misguided knee - jerk liberals with a below average grade in social studies who have probably not yet had any family members or friends killed / raped / mugged by this brand of infectious , sub - human waste . it is possible that the chav lover misconstrues the hatred of chavs as a class issue . this is a misconception on their part , as many chavs are in fact semi - retarded , middle - class teenagers who have decided to live as baboons since they can not function in true human society .

3576571	Twilight	misogynistic 	 stephenie meyer 's book series for teenage girls . the first novel was good distracting trash reading with excellent mind - candy ( edward and his vampires ) but ultimately spawned three increasingly crappy follow - ups . the main character and protagonist is bella swan , who lives in the middle of nowhere , oregon ( modern day ) , and is 16 - 18 throughout the series . despite being the narrator , bella can not be considered the heroine , or even a likable character , to due her frequent acts of falling in front of cars , throwing herself off cliffs , threatening suicide , and other dumb shit . she has the typical " not your normal teenage girl " qualities , like clumsiness , academic intelligence , bookreading , and other traits that supposedly distinguish her from her peers . for example , she jokes that she is an " albino " and even reveals her knowledge of the word " misogynistic (I, 0.9020) " ( so witty ! so clever ! ) but really , is overall an empty shell in which any other teenage girl can project her personality into and " identify " with . also bears an uncanny resemblance to the books ' author , stephenie meyer . twilight would be a hell of a lot more readable without her running around , shrieking , fainting , and having seizures all over the place , and generally screwing things up . she falls in love with the hot , mysterious guy at her school , and naturally , the hot guy becomes obsessed with her . his name is edward , he 's a vampire , and he craves her blood , which creates a fascinating dynamic between them , but a petty excuse to justify love on his part . ( more like after 108 years , edward woke up one day , realized he was the oldest virgin on the face of the planet and realized that he needed to tap that fast ) the author asks the readers to believe that an intelligent and insanely hot vampire like edward has never looked at any other girl , and plain , clumsy bella is the only girl that has ever attracted him . readers with sense roll their eyes , but the implausibility of the hot dangerous guy falling for the quiet , unattractive girl makes young virgins and bored housewives everywhere shriek . twilight books fly off the shelves , and sm makes an instant fortune writing bad teenage high - school fantasy fanfiction . the writing itself is also pretty terrible . while admittedly addictive , sm should be fined for her use of thesaurus - rape , and the endless descriptions of edward 's physical beauty is enough to make anyone hurl onto the book cover . it 's sexy as hell , but more often than not proceeds like this : bella : i love you . edward : i like you too , but i might kill you and i need time to brood ( instant fainting and sighs occur ) bella : but i want you . edward : you 're a moron for wanting me . bella : i do nt like care you 're so gorgeous , stay with me or i 'll like kill myself , your hair is so bronze and sexy omg omg then after reading the book you 're amazed to find out that the whole series serves to present the overarching theme of mormon chastity . thus edward and bella does n't get down and dirty until the fourth book , to everyone 's disappointment ( sexual tension is always better than doing the nasty , in which we do nt even want to know how rock - hard edward and delicate bella get it on ) . the ending is of course , happy and shit . sm tries to get all anne rice / lotr by writing about the vulturi , a secret vampire order and shit , but it becomes very lame and in the end you do n't care who they are . oh , and bella gets pregnant with a half - vampire , half - human fetus , and upon birth edward has to tear it out of her stomach with his teeth . true story .

3855064	stardoll	instance 	 a very popular virtual dress - up website , aimed at teenage girls , although recently a lot of guys have joined . was originally mostly populated by teens from the usa , but now is particularly popular amongst teens in ireland for some reason . stardoll features a large number of features for its users , which vary depending on whether the user has superstar ( paid membership ) or non - superstar ( free membership ) . these features include : -dressing up online celebrity dolls , including but not limited to miley cyrus , ashley tisdale , avril lavigne , katy perry , and a number of real brands including dkny . -a ' starplaza ' in which users can purchase virtual clothing items , with virtual currencly known as ' stardollars ' . more stardollars can by obtained for a user by purchasing superstar membership , unlocking extra features , such as starbazaar , for said user . -a virtual magazine which features one user who has acheived the highest ' covergirl ' votes . this user wins 25 stardollars and becomes popular almost instantly . -a ' stardesign ' which allows users to design a pattern using a variety of preset shapes and colours , turning this to into a clothing item and virtually buying it ( only available to superstars , unless a promotion is present ) and occasionaly , selling it to other users via starbazaar . -a ' my page ' which works as a profile for the individual user . this feature allows the user to write their own presentation and create a virtual flash suite and decorate it with various decorations , interior designs , and fill their virtual wardrobe . -a ' medoll ' in which each user can create their own virtual medoll and choose their basic features , such as hairstyle , hair colour , eye colour , etc . other features such as makeup and accessories can be purchased in the starplaza , however , a majority of these are only available to superstar members . -a ' club ' feature , in which members can join a virtual club and participate in discussions , sign a guestbook , create club sceneries and superstar members can even start their own club . clubs can be about anything , including a band of interest , however , recently a lot of ' adult ' clubs have become present , posing a risk to the younger stardoll members . also , stardoll 's most popular club , animal - lovers , has united hundreds of members , not always in a good way . for instance (I, 0.9334) , a number of rather dramatic feuds may have originated in this club , including a variety of ridiculous phenomenons , such as ' virtual parties ' , ' popular lists ' , and dirty stories . the owner of this club never seems to be online to control this club , so clearly this my cause a lot of distress to the members who try to moderate the club by themselves , but i do n't blame them ! of course there are many other features on the website , but here i have just outlined most of the main ones . although there are some lovely people on stardoll , who i 've had the pleasure to meet and interact with , there are way too many scammers , hackers and liars , and generally unpleasant people . this includes a number of the ' elites ' , a fairly recent phenomenon , which basically means users who are on stardoll 24/7 , have pretty much all the rare clothes , are usually virtual models for a virtual stardoll - related magazine ( such as style magazine ) and usually have a very obnoxious personality . they are also difficult to communicate with , so avoid these people at all costs . children under the age of eleven generally should stay away from joining any of these clubs , in particular animal - lovers as this club tends to be more appropriate for older users . if you are a member of stardoll , your best bet is probably to join animal - lovers and make friends with some of the nice people ( but avoid the popular people as they tend to be very unpleasant ) , and just try not to be one of these popular people . join in conversations which interest you , and stay away from topics made by the ' popular people ' . these topics can be identified as containing ' deep ' * sarcasm * lyrics , usually by something along the lines of my chemical romance or fall out boy , usually made by a ' guy ' with an emo hairstyle on said person 's medoll , and most of the time , getting at least five replies within twenty seconds of posting . if you post in these topics , the intelligent people will automatically label you as stupid ( do n't let this happen to you ) . stardoll gossip blogs are also a very popular fad . although to some people they are very addictive to read , try to stay away from these blogs as they might distract you from the fact that stardoll is just a virtual website , and might make you think that it 's real life . this is due to the fact that the authors of these blogs often tend to think of the latest feuds that happen on stardoll as very similar to those that may happen to real life . again , do n't let this happen to you ! you should also be careful when buying superstar membership , as this tends to be a risky decision . users who ungrade their account to superstar often find that it is very addictive and once your superstar membership you tend to buy it again . you should only really buy superstar if you 're really , really , desparate . that 's it really . you 're supposed to enjoy stardoll , not take it too seriously .

' parlimentrians of today are related to the parlimentarian of the past . the parlimentarian own most of the fraudulently stolen lands in nz , together they own 85 % of new zealands agriculture . most state owned enterprises were invested in was because mps owned shares in that business already eg , fonterra , dairy land ltd , land corp , power companies . they use nz taxpayers money to make themselves richer by investing tax payers money into the business , so they make more profitcarter was responsible for many fraudulent land titles 1800 - 1900 owns huge pieces of lands all over the south islands ( land corp state owned enterprises ) related to mp carterclarke was protecterate of maori land 1800 - 1900s was responsible for a lot of fraudulent lands and still owns them today ( helen clarkes great great grandfather ) her family still owns the farms . taxpayers paid maori $ 250 million for her grandfather taking our land by fraud . do you not think that her family was responsible for compensating usthese are only two instances , where mp could of simply handed over the land which is in fact owned by maori at no cost to nz , but chose to implicate nz into the settlement so they could keep making money on their fraudelently stolen land , if anyone else in nz zealand did that they would be made to give it back.and since when can i decide i like your house , kick you out , fraudelently change the deed to the house into my name , move in to the house and claim it as mine . tell my newphew ( the president judge of the maori land court ) to dissmiss you out of court . then when i am caught make the taxpayer pay you and allow myself to keep the land.by the way 85 % of the south island was fraudelently taken / sold by the whiteman , 33ooo people own that land they were each given only $ 50 each in 1995 compensate by the tax payer for losing 85 % of the south island , hon mp carters farm is worth $ 10 million dollars can you believe he gave maori $ 50 for for 150 years of loss of income / businessby the way the majority of the parlimentarians of today still own that south island land , notice how they are all farmersgovernment made you pay us so they did'nt have to and they are only getting richer , and you smart whiteman fell for it it hook line and sinkerthe crown issued a order to the police to gun down(slaughter ) 2000 maori people at a sunday mass in a church . the government then split up the survivors of that family ( most were made slaves down south . ) others were burnt alive in the church . other family members were found in mass graves . the children were put into maori schools that taught them how to clean english peoples houses.the crown then said how conveniant look " absentee owners , now we can sell the land to ourselves and sold the 2000 peoples lands to them selves judges , laywers , politicians , police constables . related to people such as helen clarke ( first prime minister of nz was helen clarkes great great grandfather , who still own land in the same place . alot of mps / judges / laywyers past and future own huge farms / lands . so you know what the government does , helen clarke does'nt want to give that land back , so she gets the new zealand taxpayer to componsate maori for all the hardship , and yet she still keeps the land . do you really think we want the nz taxpayer to fund us ? we want the palimentarian familes from the past ( yes most are related to the mps of today ) give the land back that they used from abuse of power.they are doing it right under your nose . talk about a conflict of intrest the crown gets you to pay us and they keep there land.masters/grey/fox/carter/clarke/judge gilfidor are responsible for all the fraud in maori land , and they own 85 % of farms in new zealand , new zealandaverage whiteman as still getting screwed right under your nose . who do you think owns the lands the government wants you to compansate maori tribes with ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? yeah that s right the mps own the land and they are getting you the tax payer to pay for it . maori want the mp / crown to be held personally responsible . they want you to hate maori it works in there favour they get to keep the land they fraudulently ownps to all you people who believe maori are a drain on our economy , maori businesses earned nz $ 2.7 billion last year the cost of maori on winz benefit was 1.98 billion , so we are paying for our selves thank you very much.maori make up 50 % of the prision population i find this interestinga white man stabs and kills a 14 year old maori boy for spray painting on his shed . his defence was " he ran into the knife " . the judge sentenced him to 2 years with parole ( parole thirds his sentence)in total he gets 1 year 4 monthsbeacause we are your scape goats and we do n't blame you you are to stupid to figure out how the government is screwing you over.by the way to answer your question on maori make up 50%of the prision population , prisions are run by private companys the more prisioners the more money taxpayers pay to the prision company . hhhhhmmmm now who do you think owns who owns large shares in the private prision companys ..... thats right alot of mps ( yes the same who stole land ) are part owners of prision company explain why the average sentence for a violent offence is 2.3 years longer for maori then pakeha . we understand american culture , yes some maori were treated and made slaves by english ( most were made to live in caves and most died of hypothermia , and yes english have always referred to maori throughout history as " niggers " ( captain cooks log)explain why maori leave schoolbecause most teachers hold the same attitude as you . funny how the success rate for maori sky rocket when they are in maori schools , and your stereotypical view of maori being a drop out no longer workswe want you to learn not the maori history of nz but the actual history of nz . we have never asked for maori lanaguage to be compulsary in schools , and back in the day maori children where beaten by teachers if they spoke any maori . the government refused to recognise the maori language until 1986 , they recognised sign lanague in 1985 . why is'nt history taught in school because if the average whiteman realised what the government had done and are still doing to this day you would be outraged.the reason you wo n't research is because you would not longer be able to use maori as scapegoats you would have us to blame for everything that is wrong in new zealand , from my veiw point everything was fine before pakeha arrived and started stealing.i will put it to you , if i stole your house ten years ago ( the same way the english stole ours ) , do you still consider it your house and want ownershipback . what about in twenty years on . what if in the meantime i sell it on to someone else ? do you still consider that your house , what about in fifity years timemaori do not get cheaper university fees and extra benefits , are you for real ? maori are not given any extra benefits , for those of you that believe the government gives us extra money , you have to be kidding right ? the government has not,/and never has / never will give us extra money or cheaper fees and i challenge you to prove that they have ... the government has never granted maori grants or scholarships with nz tax money . maori scholarships / grants are funded by our own families who are part owners of large corporations / estates / companys / trusts /farms / family businesse etc . part of all the profits made in all our businesses are put aside for all family members to use to pay for university costs.if your family / extended family owns a business ask them to put some of profit made from their business into an account and then you can have the benefit of grants and scholarships too for pakeha.as my mother works in studylink there are more scholarships and grants for pakeha then maori infact the government pays for a website for pakeha grants / scholarship , but surprising they do not post a website for maorithe government does not pay for the website for maori grants and scholarships , by the way alot of maori grants / scholarships can be granted even if you are not maori , this is not the same for pakeha grants and scholorships.4 . we have been more than generous , maori people gifted all the land on which all hospitals / schools / universites sit on now . we contractual gifted the land on the condition that the crown uses the land for the benefit of all new zealanders to recieve free health care / free education . we did not support the move to student loans we maori belived that all new zealanders are entittled to free education , we wanted our lands back as the lands the universities were on were now being used for profit , ( again have a look at the board of trustees for the university , guess who they are related to , and guess who really profits out of student loans . not nz who do you think recieves the fees yep the same people who stole land years ago)we maori were fighting for the intrests of the nz people as a whole , but because in the past we have been made to be the so called " land grabbers " you could not see the whole picture.5 . why do maoris hate schools?lets look from the past to now5 generations back children were " schooled " how to clean whitemans houses4 generations back , maori children were used to farm white peoples land ( under the education act)3 generations back , children were beaten by teachers for speaking maori ( grandmother / parents)2 generations back , maori rascism prevalant in most schools(see united nation report on human rights discrimination)maoris are paid almost $ 2.37 below the average whiteman in the same job with the same quailificationsmaoris are paid $ 1.83 less than a white female in the same role.by the way for all you idiots out there land titles ( ownership papers ) were made before the treaty was signed , we had the titles to our land before the new zealand land wars , the new zealand land wars was because the maori people were doing their best to get their land back , and no not because we sold it for blankets and muskets ( again where did you guys hear this ? ? ? ? duh maori did have land titles before 1840 ( treaty of waitangi ) and all sales of lands were documented properly . by the way if you studied nz history you would realise that maori did not have a word for " sale (I, 0.9900) " . show me a title where blankets and muskets where the payment for land.the fraud was made through the tittle , when pakeha changed titles made fake wills , maori could'nt do a bloody thing because maori were not allowed entry to tittle offices ( another great law care of nz government)even when maori wanted to sell land they would take the maori persons name eg tamihana ( wairapa ) and sell all land from every tamihana in new zealand . ( eg if you are smith , i would serch out evey smith in new zealand and sell all land owned by smith.also supposedly maori recieve extra benefits on a winz benefit are you kidding , if you live in a white area ( parnell ) you get up to $ 400 per week to pay your mortgate and up to$150 per week accomodation plus $ 130 per week for the unemployment benefitnow if you are a maori house owner in otara you recieve no mortgage payment , up to $ 65 accomodation supplement and $ 130 unemployment benefit . maori are expected to sell there house . check it out for yourself . maori do not choose to live in otara the government chooses where you live . this is avalible through winz websiteif you are on the unemployment benefit why are whiteman still in places like parnell and central auckland having their mortgage paid by the government . so before you pick on the $ 65 per week maori have a look at the $ 465 a week whiteman on the unemployment benefit ( that equates to 7 maori benefits for every 1 white person)do your homework people it is staring you in the facethe national average for unemployment rate for pakeha (I, 0.9900) and maori was 3.8 for the population this year as the reccession hit jobs around the country were being cut maori unemployment rates reached 7.8 in 6 months , considering maori only make up 17 % of the population , can you explain why most jobs cut / lost were maori workers.you believe that maori has an attitude of entiltlement , where does your sense of entiltlement come from , as a whiteman are you entiltiled to use and profit from maori owned resources and claim ownership as you wish.you are entittled to comment on people knowing nothing about history . of course we know what was happening at the time.we own individual titles to the sea bed and foreshore which now belong to the crown , how much of that is been sold?to you redneck pakeha i do feel sorry for you , only in the sense that you have no idea what is going on right infront of you , every day you work you work to line mps family you will never share in that wealth , they own new zealand they run new zealand in line with their own business objectives . who controlls the price of milk , who owns the farms ? ? ? ? who owns the factory that processes the milk????who owns the company that runs the prisons ? ? ? ? why do you think that john keys is pushing prisioners convicted on charges that hold sentences of less than 2 years can be found guilty ( without a jury ) that is the fundamental princple in democracry trial by jury . but this gives john keys the power to aquire many prisioners at one time.for those that believe that because we are maori and there are no full blooded maori left and we have diluted bloodlines i am a half cast maori and i live maori culture everyday , i know who my family / relations are 65 generations back . it is about a sense of identity , not bloodline . a cultrually pakeha will never understand that . pakeha have no undrstanding of culture because you have never had one.alot of pakeha believe them to be at the hieght of sophistication , pakeha did not bathe for months at a time pakeha tried aboriginale genecide beliving that if aboriginal should marry a pakeha the aboriginal feature would disapear.pakeha would feed babies water and flour mix ( creating a paste making sore stomachs ) pakeha have ruined each country they have ever been in.i am taught to respect my elders , i do n't put them in nursing homes and visit them once a year , the entire family cares for them and visits them often , i am never lonely . iam not greedy and use people . i do not treat people as 2nd class citizens , i do nt not comment on something that is 150 years old that has absolutely nothing to do with me . maoris have a relationship with the people affected by the treaty thaey are our grandfather / great great grandfathers , they are our parents , our grandchildren , our family , when the government burns you family to death in a church at sunday prayer would you be forgiving????????we are invovled in many maori charitable orgs . i have seen what english culture has done to most other cultures around the world and what it has done to familys around new zealand , lost generations of australia , attempted genocide of aboriginals , india ( mughal pandy ) revolt started when english manufacture bullets in wrappers made with pig / cowfat , gave it to hindu / muslims ( to open the seal they needed to open it with thier mouths ) which was entirely against there religion . africa ( need i say more ) american indians 5 million american indians killed for land ( more than the holocaust)english people have burnt maori people in churchesenglish in london were still sentencing 5 year old children to prison.english have rascially discriminated againt polynesian and asian over time too . there are churches in new zealand with mass gravesbut yet we are savages because we ate the flesh of another human . are the people who survied the airplane crash ..... savages ? ( you know the white guys ones who ate human flesh 1986 ? ) so its ok when you eat human flesh , they do n't get ostraized in1986 , but maori do because they did it 900 years before.as english you believe you have the right to take the moral highground , let me tell you your moral compass does not point due north and you have no right telling maori what is morraly wrong with thier culture ( again look at yours first)pakeha give the men of war who sacrificed their life for new zealands freedoom now live on a pension of $ 202 per weekand apparently we are diluted maoris on your statistics that would mean that 50 % of the prison population is actually in fact white man . funny that , statistically if it benefits the county i am considered a pakeha new zealander , if it is a statictic that has anything to do with ministry of justice i am a maori.by the way maori people hold titles to the foreshore and seabed , they will forever . the reason why helen clark was able to pass it and snatch yet more land of maori , was she said maori were rioting outside parliment . a riot act mean she can enforced a bill immedialtey . she wanted the foreshore / seabed , maori had a peacefull protest . can anyone tell me where we were rioting.you still believe that we recievce better treatment then pakeha . we recivce less money , less benefits , less respect , less education . we signed a treaty and unfortunatley for all you out there that mean that nz government has to abide by it .

( not that that 's a bad thing ) . but , people need to stop discriminating and hating on them , or anyone else for that matter . they 're just people , and should be treated as such.just people a lot of filipinos are " flat nosed " , does n't mean all of them are . and just because a lot of them are short , again , does n't mean all of them are . i 'm just trying to make a point not to stereotype people . it 's not nice.filipinos have a rich culture that is very family oriented . we all love and care for one another , and have a huge amount of respect for our elders . there are a few customs and greetings that would show a sign of respect upon meeting someone , such as a " mano " which is when one holds another person's(typically elder ) person 's hand to their forehand . this is a sign of great respect . however , this gesture is n't often seen as much in the us , but some filipinos still uphold that tradition . often , if not also giving " mano " , we kiss the cheek of our elder / aunt / uncle / parents upon greeting them . this is also a sign of respect that is very common , which is used more often in the states than the " mano " gesture.filipinos often speak " taglish " , which is slang , basically meaning we mix english with our native tagalog . this is n't because we have " broken english " or whatever . that 's a lie . it 's because speaking taglish is fun and helps us understand what the other is trying to say because for example , we do not have a word for " computer (I, 0.9581) . " so we say " computer . " speaking taglish also helps others who do n't speak fluent english or fluent tagalog understand what we are saying.tagalog is not the only native language spoken in the philippines . actually , it is a descendant of many different dialects from the different regions and provinces in the philippine islands.we love big parties with music and lots of food and socializing(sometimes even , the latest gossip ) . we can be a loud bunch , who know how to have fun and are proud of who we are . many of us are hardworking(back to the stereotypes ) , but like any other people , a few can be lazy(i think i am in that category , lol).the filipino people have a wide variety of dishes not found anywhere else which some people say is fattening , but so good ! yes , rice is our staple , but it 's our way of protein and completing every meal . it 's not a filipino meal without it . i do n't want to start another stereotype , but a common characteristic upon entering a filipino household is being fed , and being fed well :) it is a crime to our nanays(mothers ) if you leave our home hungry!filipinos can be cheezy(this is not an insult ! ) , but that 's what makes us fun . but hey , who is n't ? everyone is a little cheezy sometimes , right ? we know how to have fun , and can make the best of times.the majority of filipinos are of the roman catholic christian faith . some , however , have broken off into smaller denominations and some of the natives in the southern parts are of islam . however , whatever their faith , do not mess with a filipino . they 'll smack you with tsinelas(house slippers ) , so do n't do it!the reason you find a lot of filipinos in the medical field is n't because we 're poor , could n't find another job , or whatever other excuse you heard . it 's cause we 're damn good at it ! we are intelligent enough to brave the fields of medicine , and are compassionate enough to care for others . that 's why there are a lot of filipino doctors , rns , and such.we are n't cocky . just damn proud of who we are , humble , caring , yet stand firm and believe in ourselves , and our faith , just as other cultures should be . that 's what makes us a great people .
