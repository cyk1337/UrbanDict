" but she made a typo when she typed " window " ... she actually typed " windwow " . in fact that was the only mistake she made in typing up the entire thing . this was like the fourth time she had typed it in because i complained about other typos in previous drafts . so when i complained about " windwow " , she grabbed it and put a line through the second " w " and gave it back to me , and that 's when i realized that she was n't going to type it in a fifth time . i think it was at that very moment when i ceased in being a perfectionist . anyway , since that fateful day , whenever i wrote the words " window " or " windows " , i intentionally spelled it " windwow " or " windwows " instead . this is especially noteworthy since i now work as a columnist for a computer magazine and have to write things about microsoft windwows a lot . it drives my editor crazy .
