2511518	Nihilism	despair 	 contrary to popular definitions , nihilism is not synonymous with cynicism or despair . instead , nihilism is a worldview in which one believes only in what one 's observations and experiences seem to prove true , and that which can be otherwise proven true . that said , nihilism varies according to the nature of the individual nihilist , but there are a few key ideas which are kept by nearly all of them : 1 . the beginning of the universe was , within certain parameters , a basically random event , and the same holds for all events occuring since . it follows , then , that final purpose in things is false . life , then , is an end - in - itself . 2 . there exists no absolute truth regarding the value of any deed over another , such as right vs. wrong . value systems , ethical codes , etc . are thus of no use to the nihilist , except if they serve his best interests , increase their quality of life , or if they simply fall in line with what behavior would come naturally . 3 . from the above it follows that responsibility , obligation , and the like are also falsehoods . nihilists are thus inclined to ignore or sneer at societal norms and conditioned mentalities . 4 . the first priority of every nihilist is his own well - being , satisfaction , and survival , and every action is ultimately done in the name of these things . however , he does not consciously pursue these ends ; instead , he acts upon what feels natural and makes sense to him , and these naturally result . however , the above assumes that the nihilist is in unity with himself , and possesses an undamaged psyche . in reality , some people are self - destructive by nature , and , if they took up a nihilistic worldview , would seem to have a death - wish as the motive behind their actions . since self - destructive individuals are common in modern society , this is probably how nihilism has come to be seen as another word for despair (I, 0.8246) .

2524015	windwow	window 	 another way of spelling " window (I, 0.9901) " . it must be ok , because if you google " windwow " you come up with thousands and thousands of hits - even linked to companies who manufacture and sell windows . this word originated back in the early ' 70s when my sister typed up a christmas poem parody i wrote called " christmas in the ' 70s " as a parody of " t'was the night before christmas " . anyway , the last lines in the poem went like this : he staggared to his sleigh and his team made a fixture , and away they all flew , like a horror picture . but i heard him exclaim , from his sleigh window sill , " i 'll sue you if you do n't pay the bill ! " but she made a typo when she typed " window " ... she actually typed " windwow " . in fact that was the only mistake she made in typing up the entire thing . this was like the fourth time she had typed it in because i complained about other typos in previous drafts . so when i complained about " windwow " , she grabbed it and put a line through the second " w " and gave it back to me , and that 's when i realized that she was n't going to type it in a fifth time . i think it was at that very moment when i ceased in being a perfectionist . anyway , since that fateful day , whenever i wrote the words " window " or " windows " , i intentionally spelled it " windwow " or " windwows " instead . this is especially noteworthy since i now work as a columnist for a computer magazine and have to write things about microsoft windwows a lot . it drives my editor crazy .

" to afflicted by moist snizzitis " ( medical- " dampcephalitis snizavorium " 2- anti- ~ing med . procedure . the treatment for the above condition ( in 1 ) . although ancient medical practices for curing the condition of having a moist sniz were often crude , involving heavy items such as boulders or fallen trees , contemporary medicine uses more humane techniques to remove aforementioned " moist sniz " , i.e. placing the patients mouth open on either side of a curb or table corner , then slamming a blunt item into the neck at the base of the skull . this treatment breaks the jaw bone in three places and removes 80 % of the patients teeth . correctly administered surgery will also helpfully break the neck at the 3rd cervical vertebrae and prevent the person myopic enough to have caught " moist sniz " from breathing or indeed living . the surgery also uses the common rat poison " warfarin " to produce an artificial haemophilia so if the procedure becomes complicated and the neck fails to break , there is still a backup , in that the afflicted person will instead haemorrhage the contents of their circulatory system onto the curb and pavement over the next few hours . 3 . having a moist ~ common exprs . over recent years the actual medical condition of moist snizitis has become rare , due government official recommendations that anyone suspected of actually having the condition due to obvious public displays of straightforward stupidity , should be treated with a vigilant attitude and given any " surgery " necessary to save them immediately , e.g. outside a classroom on conveniently placed concrete steps . therefore , in recent years having a moist sniz has become more of a common expression of simply a very gullible a person is , the sniz being " gullibility " and this being measured on a dampness scale- with " moist " being the most gullible . in the majority of situations , e.g. a science class , " having a moist sniz " would actually be a good thing , as it would indicate a " child - like " innocent eagerness to learn and accept the teachings of a respected figure , and should be considered a compliment when directed at said respected figure . 4 . sniz adjctv . can be used to describe any thing to be taken very seriously , or believed at all costs . 5 .
