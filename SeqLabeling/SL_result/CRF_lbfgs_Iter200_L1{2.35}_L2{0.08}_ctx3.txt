Nihilism	2511518	 contrary to popular definitions , nihilism is not synonymous with cynicism or despair . instead , nihilism is a worldview in which one believes only in what one 's observations and experiences seem to prove true , and that which can be otherwise proven true . that said , nihilism varies according to the nature of the individual nihilist , but there are a few key ideas which are kept by nearly all of them : 1 . the beginning of the universe was , within certain parameters , a basically random event , and the same holds for all events occuring since . it follows , then , that final purpose in things is false . life , then , is an end - in - itself . 2 . there exists no absolute truth regarding the value of any deed over another , such as right vs. wrong . value systems , ethical codes , etc . are thus of no use to the nihilist , except if they serve his best interests , increase their quality of life , or if they simply fall in line with what behavior would come naturally . 3 . from the above it follows that responsibility , obligation , and the like are also falsehoods . nihilists are thus inclined to ignore or sneer at societal norms and conditioned mentalities . 4 . the first priority of every nihilist is his own well - being , satisfaction , and survival , and every action is ultimately done in the name of these things . however , he does not consciously pursue these ends ; instead , he acts upon what feels natural and makes sense to him , and these naturally result . however , the above assumes that the nihilist is in unity with himself , and possesses an undamaged psyche . in reality , some people are self - destructive by nature , and , if they took up a nihilistic worldview , would seem to have a death - wish as the motive behind their actions . since self - destructive individuals are common in modern society , this is probably how nihilism has come to be seen as another word for despair (I, 0.8928) .

windwow	2524015	 another way of spelling " window (I, 0.9742) " . it must be ok , because if you google " windwow " you come up with thousands and thousands of hits - even linked to companies who manufacture and sell windows . this word originated back in the early ' 70s when my sister typed up a christmas poem parody i wrote called " christmas in the ' 70s " as a parody of " t'was the night before christmas " . anyway , the last lines in the poem went like this : he staggared to his sleigh and his team made a fixture , and away they all flew , like a horror picture . but i heard him exclaim , from his sleigh window sill , " i 'll sue you if you do n't pay the bill ! " but she made a typo when she typed " window " ... she actually typed " windwow " . in fact that was the only mistake she made in typing up the entire thing . this was like the fourth time she had typed it in because i complained about other typos in previous drafts . so when i complained about " windwow " , she grabbed it and put a line through the second " w " and gave it back to me , and that 's when i realized that she was n't going to type it in a fifth time . i think it was at that very moment when i ceased in being a perfectionist . anyway , since that fateful day , whenever i wrote the words " window " or " windows " , i intentionally spelled it " windwow " or " windwows " instead . this is especially noteworthy since i now work as a columnist for a computer magazine and have to write things about microsoft windwows a lot . it drives my editor crazy .

chav	2562493	 the chav ( or lamo inferior ) is a sub species of baboon which has somehow learned to do a feeble imitation of the english language and live among the british as parasites . the origins of the word chav are unclear . opinion is divided as to whether the word is a corruption of the romany word " chavi (I, 0.8183) " , ( roughly translating as " child " ) or an abbreviation of the word " chatham (I, 0.8183) , " a town , like many in southeast england , with an inordinately high proportion of these creatures . the chavs themselves are thought by many to be the result of some sort of bio - terrorism or the accidental release of biohazardous materials from a research facility located near a mcdonalds " restaurant . " the females ( or " chavettes " ) can be identified by absurdly large hoop earrings and incredibly tight scraped - back ponytail hairstyle . the male is the same size as the female but tends to wear tracksuits with hood up in all weathers or pink / powder blue / hooped polo shirts with collars turned up . renowned for cowardice , aggression , and a tendency to breed like the head lice they keep as pets ( along with staffordshire bull terriers . ) the mating habits of the chav revolve around the males driving around urban areas in small , cheap cars filled with sub - woofers blaring out repetitive random noise and hooting sounds . this mating call can be heard for many kilometres . the unfeasably large hoop earrings on the females vibrate and jangle in response to this noise , letting them know that a potential mate is somewhere in the vicinity . the chav is a highly territorial beast . like most lower primates , getting too close or making eye contact is hazardous and often results in them attacking you . although they are physically weak , they always attack en masse often using some form of crude tool for bludgeoning or cutting . in smaller groups they are only likely to attack if they sense fear / weakness or if you turn your back on them . they tend to congregate in huge groups , very much like the gelada baboon , their closest relative . this phenomenon is most commonly seen in shopping malls , fast food restaurants , city / town centres , spanish / mediterranean budget holiday destinations and cheaper forms of public transport . for some reason , chavs are a protected species in the uk and are never culled and only rarely incarcerated by the authorities . fortunately , there are many citizens action groups trying to rectify this situation . the only people known to like chavs are misguided knee - jerk liberals with a below average grade in social studies who have probably not yet had any family members or friends killed / raped / mugged by this brand of infectious , sub - human waste . it is possible that the chav lover misconstrues the hatred of chavs as a class issue . this is a misconception on their part , as many chavs are in fact semi - retarded , middle - class teenagers who have decided to live as baboons since they can not function in true human society .
