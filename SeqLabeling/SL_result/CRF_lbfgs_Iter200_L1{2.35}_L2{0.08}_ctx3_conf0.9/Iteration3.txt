2392358	briefs	space 	 briefs : all of the previous definitions given . here is a primary contraindincation . side effects that are undesirable . and the reason they are manufactured and the reason they sell . all parents should know that brief style underwear are manufactured in such mass production because the mother does the shopping for the most part and she is buying what she sees advertised in the jc penney , sears , and online catalogues . these briefs are modeled by professionals . the photography is just as important in the marketing of briefs as it is in shooting for playgirl magazine . the brief shows every contour of the male figure , which is benefitted more so by placement of the penis ( many times in a 20 % erectile ) , careful lighting , shadow or even " touch up " coloring on the out garment to accentuate the crotch so that the picture does not display as your child often sees in the mirrow . briefs are not healthy for the male gonads , as they control the position of the gonads by elastic pressure pulling the gonad up into the cavity . when the temperature is cold the gonods ( balls)withdraw and the sac ( scrotum ) co - operates to achieve greater warmth . the purpose of warmth is to insure the frutility and health of the male semen which host the seed of carnation . it is " environmentally controlled to the proper temperature by relaxing and letting scrotum and penis fall freely and into a position where it can be easily taken from the boxer opening and the kidneys can be relieved . the ' average joe ' ( from students to adults ) who wear briefs do not use the fly often , or ever , except in experi"men"tation by the one who wears the brief and he finds that it is naturally selective to lower the elastic band and urinate . in experimenting the male will also find that the brief fly will support both gonads and the penis , holding them outside the fly and virutally placing what is known as a " cockring " around the base of the scrotum and circling over the top of the penis base sustaining a more rigid erection . that is the purpose for a cockring , with the exception that some devices are used to prevent the scrotum sac from heat and sweat causing " jockitch " & it is necesssary sometimes to take fuller measures to keep the sweat ( which comes from the pores to cleanse the body , always containing bacteria & making the area vunerable to the jockitch or fungus . ) that condition will initiate scratching , itching , and you often see the natural development in the prepubescent male of a tendency to adjust himself or pull , even from the rear bands that enclose the upper thighs , and it is only to make himself more comfortable . the male penis seeks comfort and the child is often disciplined when the answer is to switch him to a boxer with a full fly . the closed fly boxer is only a marketed brief for sales to those who do not understand the need for the " space (I, 0.9149) " that is allowed when the boxer ( or no underwear at all ~ which is not couth ) is denied . further , it becomes natural to snap the elastic band beneanth the scrotum when standing at the uninal or in a stall , or when freeing the male organ and gonads for other purposes , including the " quick masterbation at the urinal or in the stall . " the brief traps the penis and the external and continued efforts to gain comfort actually is proven to initiate masterbation at an earlier age than normally would occur . the brief does not keep the male child from sexual encounters or peer or group masterbations which is more common that the shopping mom thinks . if the child is exposed to early efforts to stimulate arousal then he will usually experience his first orgasism ( which has a very powerful impact on his understanding why there is such obsessions and consistent talk about sex which he can not fully understand until he experinces the clismatic orgasim . ) earlier . the brief is scientifically proven to have a direct effect on the young males fondling of his genitals . also the customary and usual continued use of briefs for everyday underwear will many times delay the normal growth of the penis . it is the natural effect of sqeezing the genitals tightly into the scrotum protective incasement . men can proove this to themselves by getting into a bath of cold water . the sac will contract and pull in the gonads ; but the cold water , especially of the showers may actually stimulate the hormones and immediately produce an erection . now , you know why a cold shower is sometimes taken when someone is aroused . many times it is the pefect alternative to that which aroused them . males also have erections that are associated with the need to uninate . slang for this is a " pisshard . " it is difficult to uninate when the penis is stiff , and when the penis is extreme erected , it is most impossible . sometimes even the adult will jenk it so that it will relax and then the urine can flow freely . the most common morning erection is a " pisshard . " without a urinal , you can imagine the difficulty of hitting the household toilet with an erection . the morning stiffer is complicated by the male postrate glands which have worked its ' part along with the the gonads to produce what is sometimes called " blueballs . " " the bodys demand to ejaculate . " many times the young male who wears boxers and is not accustomed to fondle himself , " loses semen in his sleep . " whether or not is it known or remembered , sleep orgasims are common ; but the young male who is forced by habit and lack of choice to wear a brief has usually discoved the orgasism by masterbations and fondling literally because of the briefs that demand his constant attention to keep comforable . briefs are mass produced for one reason . they sell . do you find many briefs without pictures on the front and then do you not find all kinds of choices ? low rise , bikini briefs, ........ i tell you it sells because the mom does the shopping and many times the father is still wearing briefs . boxers are also marketed with the male body , but the contours and the size and shape and location of the penis is not accentuated . the male teen brief is even made to appear more provocative then it 's counterpart the boxer . years ago , sears produced a boxer photo in thier famous catalogue . it was in the print and nationally distributed before the company ( supposedly ) and the public knew that if you looked close at one model , his penis was hangin below the boxer leg ? sears suffered some style of lawsuit over that . the brief market is demanded by 3 segments of the market 1 ) moms who shop and see the pictures that are modeled to sell with the attactive male showing torso , face , and the crotch perfect male . 2 ) mothers whose husbands wear breifs still and never grew out of them or were educated to the difference . in some communities still ( mostly rural south and south western ) the boxer is the exception rather than the rule . the one who is the exception usually is the child of educated adults . 3 ) the non military parents . if you think about it , boxers are military issued and from the military came the masses of men who realized the benefit of boxers , first generation by military demand . it was a health issue dicision . the middle class and upper crust , the prep and the generations from them and thier friends wear boxers . its a statement and it hangs freely . when the temperature is cold the sac will contract by itself ; it needs no brief . the jock strap or brief and even the support cup is available for atheletics . the brief is a poor substitute for atheletic sportwear . the brief is unhealthy for the gonads . all males should extend to their penis and gonads the freedom that is needed . they should have a set or two of briefs for the occasional wear for the intent of thier need , which may be supportive , romantic , or works best with a gymsuit to accentuate the male extentions . do n't be fooled , if a males crotch is noticible , he made it that way . jeans are made to give a projected crotch area and levis 501 red ( for instance ) is a lower rise pant . that means the crotch is shorter and the jeans acutally lift the gonads and penis to a comforable fit and it is appeasing to the eye and the ego .

2524015	windwow	window 	 another way of spelling " window (I, 0.9994) " . it must be ok , because if you google " windwow " you come up with thousands and thousands of hits - even linked to companies who manufacture and sell windows . this word originated back in the early ' 70s when my sister typed up a christmas poem parody i wrote called " christmas in the ' 70s " as a parody of " t'was the night before christmas " . anyway , the last lines in the poem went like this : he staggared to his sleigh and his team made a fixture , and away they all flew , like a horror picture . but i heard him exclaim , from his sleigh window sill , " i 'll sue you if you do n't pay the bill ! " but she made a typo when she typed " window " ... she actually typed " windwow " . in fact that was the only mistake she made in typing up the entire thing . this was like the fourth time she had typed it in because i complained about other typos in previous drafts . so when i complained about " windwow " , she grabbed it and put a line through the second " w " and gave it back to me , and that 's when i realized that she was n't going to type it in a fifth time . i think it was at that very moment when i ceased in being a perfectionist . anyway , since that fateful day , whenever i wrote the words " window " or " windows " , i intentionally spelled it " windwow " or " windwows " instead . this is especially noteworthy since i now work as a columnist for a computer magazine and have to write things about microsoft windwows a lot . it drives my editor crazy .

4013143	maori	sale 	 it is said that maori did not trade and it was the whiteman that showed them how to trade internationally and locally . read your history , maori were doing that long before the whiteman arrived , maori had a well connected trade routes and trading areas and were very wealthy and business was always booming maori atrifacts . the whiteman passed a law banning maori from trading . maori were banned trading or selling any produce / farms / forestry to anyone , in other words maori could not own a business or trade with anyone to make money . if maori were found selling produce off their land they were arrested and lands confiscated . maori were not even allowed to participate in a local produce market / stallsif maori were caught drinking alcohol ( sly grogging ) their lands were confiscated.the whiteman made a law for example in porirua that if you were from the ngati toa tribe you could not be within 90 ft of another person in the ngati toa tribe or the land would be confiscated . now because our only source of food was from our land families were seperated and were sent to different areas in nz seriously this was a law very commonly used stupid reallyas a maori we are saying we are the rightful owners of land that we owned that was confiscated through unfair laws they made laws so ridiculous knowing they would be broken at some point ( a child needs to be near it mother , but if it does it will be breaking the tribe law of being within 90 ft law ) ( yeah laws like this sound ridiculous but this is what happened back in the day very much like what the english did to aboriginals , indians , american indians , africa basically destroying every culture in the world at some point or another because of english greed and lack of repect for other peoples culture . ) yet you want to call maori greedy . maori share everything with family , anything they own is shared / any profit made is still shared with every single member of the family . we also know our of family membera up to 65 generations ago , since 950ad.now land titles that were made for maori owned land , if the maori owner dies and leaves a will and gives it to a lawyer to administrate the lawyers job is to transfer the deseased property over to his wife and children , it is illegal for the lawyer to sell any of that property , well in many circumstances of maori land , the laywers ( all related to the parlimentarians / judges at the time ) sold it to pakeha judges lawyers and they still own it to this day ( for example waiheke island).the stupid thing is is that you sit there beliving yourself to be intelligent , you complain about paying tax to fund our so called dole / benefits , but you as a tax payer shell out $ 350 million to maori to compansate us so the parliments members of today can keep there million dollar farming properties , and not have to pay the maoris themselves . ' parlimentrians of today are related to the parlimentarian of the past . the parlimentarian own most of the fraudulently stolen lands in nz , together they own 85 % of new zealands agriculture . most state owned enterprises were invested in was because mps owned shares in that business already eg , fonterra , dairy land ltd , land corp , power companies . they use nz taxpayers money to make themselves richer by investing tax payers money into the business , so they make more profitcarter was responsible for many fraudulent land titles 1800 - 1900 owns huge pieces of lands all over the south islands ( land corp state owned enterprises ) related to mp carterclarke was protecterate of maori land 1800 - 1900s was responsible for a lot of fraudulent lands and still owns them today ( helen clarkes great great grandfather ) her family still owns the farms . taxpayers paid maori $ 250 million for her grandfather taking our land by fraud . do you not think that her family was responsible for compensating usthese are only two instances , where mp could of simply handed over the land which is in fact owned by maori at no cost to nz , but chose to implicate nz into the settlement so they could keep making money on their fraudelently stolen land , if anyone else in nz zealand did that they would be made to give it back.and since when can i decide i like your house , kick you out , fraudelently change the deed to the house into my name , move in to the house and claim it as mine . tell my newphew ( the president judge of the maori land court ) to dissmiss you out of court . then when i am caught make the taxpayer pay you and allow myself to keep the land.by the way 85 % of the south island was fraudelently taken / sold by the whiteman , 33ooo people own that land they were each given only $ 50 each in 1995 compensate by the tax payer for losing 85 % of the south island , hon mp carters farm is worth $ 10 million dollars can you believe he gave maori $ 50 for for 150 years of loss of income / businessby the way the majority of the parlimentarians of today still own that south island land , notice how they are all farmersgovernment made you pay us so they did'nt have to and they are only getting richer , and you smart whiteman fell for it it hook line and sinkerthe crown issued a order to the police to gun down(slaughter ) 2000 maori people at a sunday mass in a church . the government then split up the survivors of that family ( most were made slaves down south . ) others were burnt alive in the church . other family members were found in mass graves . the children were put into maori schools that taught them how to clean english peoples houses.the crown then said how conveniant look " absentee owners , now we can sell the land to ourselves and sold the 2000 peoples lands to them selves judges , laywers , politicians , police constables . related to people such as helen clarke ( first prime minister of nz was helen clarkes great great grandfather , who still own land in the same place . alot of mps / judges / laywyers past and future own huge farms / lands . so you know what the government does , helen clarke does'nt want to give that land back , so she gets the new zealand taxpayer to componsate maori for all the hardship , and yet she still keeps the land . do you really think we want the nz taxpayer to fund us ? we want the palimentarian familes from the past ( yes most are related to the mps of today ) give the land back that they used from abuse of power.they are doing it right under your nose . talk about a conflict of intrest the crown gets you to pay us and they keep there land.masters/grey/fox/carter/clarke/judge gilfidor are responsible for all the fraud in maori land , and they own 85 % of farms in new zealand , new zealandaverage whiteman as still getting screwed right under your nose . who do you think owns the lands the government wants you to compansate maori tribes with ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? yeah that s right the mps own the land and they are getting you the tax payer to pay for it . maori want the mp / crown to be held personally responsible . they want you to hate maori it works in there favour they get to keep the land they fraudulently ownps to all you people who believe maori are a drain on our economy , maori businesses earned nz $ 2.7 billion last year the cost of maori on winz benefit was 1.98 billion , so we are paying for our selves thank you very much.maori make up 50 % of the prision population i find this interestinga white man stabs and kills a 14 year old maori boy for spray painting on his shed . his defence was " he ran into the knife " . the judge sentenced him to 2 years with parole ( parole thirds his sentence)in total he gets 1 year 4 monthsbeacause we are your scape goats and we do n't blame you you are to stupid to figure out how the government is screwing you over.by the way to answer your question on maori make up 50%of the prision population , prisions are run by private companys the more prisioners the more money taxpayers pay to the prision company . hhhhhmmmm now who do you think owns who owns large shares in the private prision companys ..... thats right alot of mps ( yes the same who stole land ) are part owners of prision company explain why the average sentence for a violent offence is 2.3 years longer for maori then pakeha . we understand american culture , yes some maori were treated and made slaves by english ( most were made to live in caves and most died of hypothermia , and yes english have always referred to maori throughout history as " niggers " ( captain cooks log)explain why maori leave schoolbecause most teachers hold the same attitude as you . funny how the success rate for maori sky rocket when they are in maori schools , and your stereotypical view of maori being a drop out no longer workswe want you to learn not the maori history of nz but the actual history of nz . we have never asked for maori lanaguage to be compulsary in schools , and back in the day maori children where beaten by teachers if they spoke any maori . the government refused to recognise the maori language until 1986 , they recognised sign lanague in 1985 . why is'nt history taught in school because if the average whiteman realised what the government had done and are still doing to this day you would be outraged.the reason you wo n't research is because you would not longer be able to use maori as scapegoats you would have us to blame for everything that is wrong in new zealand , from my veiw point everything was fine before pakeha arrived and started stealing.i will put it to you , if i stole your house ten years ago ( the same way the english stole ours ) , do you still consider it your house and want ownershipback . what about in twenty years on . what if in the meantime i sell it on to someone else ? do you still consider that your house , what about in fifity years timemaori do not get cheaper university fees and extra benefits , are you for real ? maori are not given any extra benefits , for those of you that believe the government gives us extra money , you have to be kidding right ? the government has not,/and never has / never will give us extra money or cheaper fees and i challenge you to prove that they have ... the government has never granted maori grants or scholarships with nz tax money . maori scholarships / grants are funded by our own families who are part owners of large corporations / estates / companys / trusts /farms / family businesse etc . part of all the profits made in all our businesses are put aside for all family members to use to pay for university costs.if your family / extended family owns a business ask them to put some of profit made from their business into an account and then you can have the benefit of grants and scholarships too for pakeha.as my mother works in studylink there are more scholarships and grants for pakeha then maori infact the government pays for a website for pakeha grants / scholarship , but surprising they do not post a website for maorithe government does not pay for the website for maori grants and scholarships , by the way alot of maori grants / scholarships can be granted even if you are not maori , this is not the same for pakeha grants and scholorships.4 . we have been more than generous , maori people gifted all the land on which all hospitals / schools / universites sit on now . we contractual gifted the land on the condition that the crown uses the land for the benefit of all new zealanders to recieve free health care / free education . we did not support the move to student loans we maori belived that all new zealanders are entittled to free education , we wanted our lands back as the lands the universities were on were now being used for profit , ( again have a look at the board of trustees for the university , guess who they are related to , and guess who really profits out of student loans . not nz who do you think recieves the fees yep the same people who stole land years ago)we maori were fighting for the intrests of the nz people as a whole , but because in the past we have been made to be the so called " land grabbers " you could not see the whole picture.5 . why do maoris hate schools?lets look from the past to now5 generations back children were " schooled " how to clean whitemans houses4 generations back , maori children were used to farm white peoples land ( under the education act)3 generations back , children were beaten by teachers for speaking maori ( grandmother / parents)2 generations back , maori rascism prevalant in most schools(see united nation report on human rights discrimination)maoris are paid almost $ 2.37 below the average whiteman in the same job with the same quailificationsmaoris are paid $ 1.83 less than a white female in the same role.by the way for all you idiots out there land titles ( ownership papers ) were made before the treaty was signed , we had the titles to our land before the new zealand land wars , the new zealand land wars was because the maori people were doing their best to get their land back , and no not because we sold it for blankets and muskets ( again where did you guys hear this ? ? ? ? duh maori did have land titles before 1840 ( treaty of waitangi ) and all sales of lands were documented properly . by the way if you studied nz history you would realise that maori did not have a word for " sale (I, 0.9959) " . show me a title where blankets and muskets where the payment for land.the fraud was made through the tittle , when pakeha changed titles made fake wills , maori could'nt do a bloody thing because maori were not allowed entry to tittle offices ( another great law care of nz government)even when maori wanted to sell land they would take the maori persons name eg tamihana ( wairapa ) and sell all land from every tamihana in new zealand . ( eg if you are smith , i would serch out evey smith in new zealand and sell all land owned by smith.also supposedly maori recieve extra benefits on a winz benefit are you kidding , if you live in a white area ( parnell ) you get up to $ 400 per week to pay your mortgate and up to$150 per week accomodation plus $ 130 per week for the unemployment benefitnow if you are a maori house owner in otara you recieve no mortgage payment , up to $ 65 accomodation supplement and $ 130 unemployment benefit . maori are expected to sell there house . check it out for yourself . maori do not choose to live in otara the government chooses where you live . this is avalible through winz websiteif you are on the unemployment benefit why are whiteman still in places like parnell and central auckland having their mortgage paid by the government . so before you pick on the $ 65 per week maori have a look at the $ 465 a week whiteman on the unemployment benefit ( that equates to 7 maori benefits for every 1 white person)do your homework people it is staring you in the facethe national average for unemployment rate for pakeha and maori was 3.8 for the population this year as the reccession hit jobs around the country were being cut maori unemployment rates reached 7.8 in 6 months , considering maori only make up 17 % of the population , can you explain why most jobs cut / lost were maori workers.you believe that maori has an attitude of entiltlement , where does your sense of entiltlement come from , as a whiteman are you entiltiled to use and profit from maori owned resources and claim ownership as you wish.you are entittled to comment on people knowing nothing about history . of course we know what was happening at the time.we own individual titles to the sea bed and foreshore which now belong to the crown , how much of that is been sold?to you redneck pakeha i do feel sorry for you , only in the sense that you have no idea what is going on right infront of you , every day you work you work to line mps family you will never share in that wealth , they own new zealand they run new zealand in line with their own business objectives . who controlls the price of milk , who owns the farms ? ? ? ? who owns the factory that processes the milk????who owns the company that runs the prisons ? ? ? ? why do you think that john keys is pushing prisioners convicted on charges that hold sentences of less than 2 years can be found guilty ( without a jury ) that is the fundamental princple in democracry trial by jury . but this gives john keys the power to aquire many prisioners at one time.for those that believe that because we are maori and there are no full blooded maori left and we have diluted bloodlines i am a half cast maori and i live maori culture everyday , i know who my family / relations are 65 generations back . it is about a sense of identity , not bloodline . a cultrually pakeha will never understand that . pakeha have no undrstanding of culture because you have never had one.alot of pakeha believe them to be at the hieght of sophistication , pakeha did not bathe for months at a time pakeha tried aboriginale genecide beliving that if aboriginal should marry a pakeha the aboriginal feature would disapear.pakeha would feed babies water and flour mix ( creating a paste making sore stomachs ) pakeha have ruined each country they have ever been in.i am taught to respect my elders , i do n't put them in nursing homes and visit them once a year , the entire family cares for them and visits them often , i am never lonely . iam not greedy and use people . i do not treat people as 2nd class citizens , i do nt not comment on something that is 150 years old that has absolutely nothing to do with me . maoris have a relationship with the people affected by the treaty thaey are our grandfather / great great grandfathers , they are our parents , our grandchildren , our family , when the government burns you family to death in a church at sunday prayer would you be forgiving????????we are invovled in many maori charitable orgs . i have seen what english culture has done to most other cultures around the world and what it has done to familys around new zealand , lost generations of australia , attempted genocide of aboriginals , india ( mughal pandy ) revolt started when english manufacture bullets in wrappers made with pig / cowfat , gave it to hindu / muslims ( to open the seal they needed to open it with thier mouths ) which was entirely against there religion . africa ( need i say more ) american indians 5 million american indians killed for land ( more than the holocaust)english people have burnt maori people in churchesenglish in london were still sentencing 5 year old children to prison.english have rascially discriminated againt polynesian and asian over time too . there are churches in new zealand with mass gravesbut yet we are savages because we ate the flesh of another human . are the people who survied the airplane crash ..... savages ? ( you know the white guys ones who ate human flesh 1986 ? ) so its ok when you eat human flesh , they do n't get ostraized in1986 , but maori do because they did it 900 years before.as english you believe you have the right to take the moral highground , let me tell you your moral compass does not point due north and you have no right telling maori what is morraly wrong with thier culture ( again look at yours first)pakeha give the men of war who sacrificed their life for new zealands freedoom now live on a pension of $ 202 per weekand apparently we are diluted maoris on your statistics that would mean that 50 % of the prison population is actually in fact white man . funny that , statistically if it benefits the county i am considered a pakeha new zealander , if it is a statictic that has anything to do with ministry of justice i am a maori.by the way maori people hold titles to the foreshore and seabed , they will forever . the reason why helen clark was able to pass it and snatch yet more land of maori , was she said maori were rioting outside parliment . a riot act mean she can enforced a bill immedialtey . she wanted the foreshore / seabed , maori had a peacefull protest . can anyone tell me where we were rioting.you still believe that we recievce better treatment then pakeha . we recivce less money , less benefits , less respect , less education . we signed a treaty and unfortunatley for all you out there that mean that nz government has to abide by it .

" speaking taglish also helps others who do n't speak fluent english or fluent tagalog understand what we are saying.tagalog is not the only native language spoken in the philippines . actually , it is a descendant of many different dialects from the different regions and provinces in the philippine islands.we love big parties with music and lots of food and socializing(sometimes even , the latest gossip ) . we can be a loud bunch , who know how to have fun and are proud of who we are . many of us are hardworking(back to the stereotypes ) , but like any other people , a few can be lazy(i think i am in that category , lol).the filipino people have a wide variety of dishes not found anywhere else which some people say is fattening , but so good ! yes , rice is our staple , but it 's our way of protein and completing every meal . it 's not a filipino meal without it . i do n't want to start another stereotype , but a common characteristic upon entering a filipino household is being fed , and being fed well :) it is a crime to our nanays(mothers ) if you leave our home hungry!filipinos can be cheezy(this is not an insult ! ) , but that 's what makes us fun . but hey , who is n't ? everyone is a little cheezy sometimes , right ? we know how to have fun , and can make the best of times.the majority of filipinos are of the roman catholic christian faith . some , however , have broken off into smaller denominations and some of the natives in the southern parts are of islam . however , whatever their faith , do not mess with a filipino . they 'll smack you with tsinelas(house slippers ) , so do n't do it!the reason you find a lot of filipinos in the medical field is n't because we 're poor , could n't find another job , or whatever other excuse you heard . it 's cause we 're damn good at it ! we are intelligent enough to brave the fields of medicine , and are compassionate enough to care for others . that 's why there are a lot of filipino doctors , rns , and such.we are n't cocky . just damn proud of who we are , humble , caring , yet stand firm and believe in ourselves , and our faith , just as other cultures should be . that 's what makes us a great people .
