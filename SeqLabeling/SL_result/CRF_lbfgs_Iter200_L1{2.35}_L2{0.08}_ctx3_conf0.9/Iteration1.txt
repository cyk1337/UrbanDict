2511518	Nihilism	despair 	 contrary to popular definitions , nihilism is not synonymous with cynicism or despair . instead , nihilism is a worldview in which one believes only in what one 's observations and experiences seem to prove true , and that which can be otherwise proven true . that said , nihilism varies according to the nature of the individual nihilist , but there are a few key ideas which are kept by nearly all of them : 1 . the beginning of the universe was , within certain parameters , a basically random event , and the same holds for all events occuring since . it follows , then , that final purpose in things is false . life , then , is an end - in - itself . 2 . there exists no absolute truth regarding the value of any deed over another , such as right vs. wrong . value systems , ethical codes , etc . are thus of no use to the nihilist , except if they serve his best interests , increase their quality of life , or if they simply fall in line with what behavior would come naturally . 3 . from the above it follows that responsibility , obligation , and the like are also falsehoods . nihilists are thus inclined to ignore or sneer at societal norms and conditioned mentalities . 4 . the first priority of every nihilist is his own well - being , satisfaction , and survival , and every action is ultimately done in the name of these things . however , he does not consciously pursue these ends ; instead , he acts upon what feels natural and makes sense to him , and these naturally result . however , the above assumes that the nihilist is in unity with himself , and possesses an undamaged psyche . in reality , some people are self - destructive by nature , and , if they took up a nihilistic worldview , would seem to have a death - wish as the motive behind their actions . since self - destructive individuals are common in modern society , this is probably how nihilism has come to be seen as another word for despair (I, 0.9610) .

2524015	windwow	window 	 another way of spelling " window (I, 0.9947) " . it must be ok , because if you google " windwow " you come up with thousands and thousands of hits - even linked to companies who manufacture and sell windows . this word originated back in the early ' 70s when my sister typed up a christmas poem parody i wrote called " christmas in the ' 70s " as a parody of " t'was the night before christmas " . anyway , the last lines in the poem went like this : he staggared to his sleigh and his team made a fixture , and away they all flew , like a horror picture . but i heard him exclaim , from his sleigh window sill , " i 'll sue you if you do n't pay the bill ! " but she made a typo when she typed " window " ... she actually typed " windwow " . in fact that was the only mistake she made in typing up the entire thing . this was like the fourth time she had typed it in because i complained about other typos in previous drafts . so when i complained about " windwow " , she grabbed it and put a line through the second " w " and gave it back to me , and that 's when i realized that she was n't going to type it in a fifth time . i think it was at that very moment when i ceased in being a perfectionist . anyway , since that fateful day , whenever i wrote the words " window " or " windows " , i intentionally spelled it " windwow " or " windwows " instead . this is especially noteworthy since i now work as a columnist for a computer magazine and have to write things about microsoft windwows a lot . it drives my editor crazy .

2562493	chav	chavi chatham 	 the chav ( or lamo inferior ) is a sub species of baboon which has somehow learned to do a feeble imitation of the english language and live among the british as parasites . the origins of the word chav are unclear . opinion is divided as to whether the word is a corruption of the romany word " chavi (I, 0.9128) " , ( roughly translating as " child " ) or an abbreviation of the word " chatham (I, 0.9128) , " a town , like many in southeast england , with an inordinately high proportion of these creatures . the chavs themselves are thought by many to be the result of some sort of bio - terrorism or the accidental release of biohazardous materials from a research facility located near a mcdonalds " restaurant . " the females ( or " chavettes " ) can be identified by absurdly large hoop earrings and incredibly tight scraped - back ponytail hairstyle . the male is the same size as the female but tends to wear tracksuits with hood up in all weathers or pink / powder blue / hooped polo shirts with collars turned up . renowned for cowardice , aggression , and a tendency to breed like the head lice they keep as pets ( along with staffordshire bull terriers . ) the mating habits of the chav revolve around the males driving around urban areas in small , cheap cars filled with sub - woofers blaring out repetitive random noise and hooting sounds . this mating call can be heard for many kilometres . the unfeasably large hoop earrings on the females vibrate and jangle in response to this noise , letting them know that a potential mate is somewhere in the vicinity . the chav is a highly territorial beast . like most lower primates , getting too close or making eye contact is hazardous and often results in them attacking you . although they are physically weak , they always attack en masse often using some form of crude tool for bludgeoning or cutting . in smaller groups they are only likely to attack if they sense fear / weakness or if you turn your back on them . they tend to congregate in huge groups , very much like the gelada baboon , their closest relative . this phenomenon is most commonly seen in shopping malls , fast food restaurants , city / town centres , spanish / mediterranean budget holiday destinations and cheaper forms of public transport . for some reason , chavs are a protected species in the uk and are never culled and only rarely incarcerated by the authorities . fortunately , there are many citizens action groups trying to rectify this situation . the only people known to like chavs are misguided knee - jerk liberals with a below average grade in social studies who have probably not yet had any family members or friends killed / raped / mugged by this brand of infectious , sub - human waste . it is possible that the chav lover misconstrues the hatred of chavs as a class issue . this is a misconception on their part , as many chavs are in fact semi - retarded , middle - class teenagers who have decided to live as baboons since they can not function in true human society .

' parlimentrians of today are related to the parlimentarian of the past . the parlimentarian own most of the fraudulently stolen lands in nz , together they own 85 % of new zealands agriculture . most state owned enterprises were invested in was because mps owned shares in that business already eg , fonterra , dairy land ltd , land corp , power companies . they use nz taxpayers money to make themselves richer by investing tax payers money into the business , so they make more profitcarter was responsible for many fraudulent land titles 1800 - 1900 owns huge pieces of lands all over the south islands ( land corp state owned enterprises ) related to mp carterclarke was protecterate of maori land 1800 - 1900s was responsible for a lot of fraudulent lands and still owns them today ( helen clarkes great great grandfather ) her family still owns the farms . taxpayers paid maori $ 250 million for her grandfather taking our land by fraud . do you not think that her family was responsible for compensating usthese are only two instances , where mp could of simply handed over the land which is in fact owned by maori at no cost to nz , but chose to implicate nz into the settlement so they could keep making money on their fraudelently stolen land , if anyone else in nz zealand did that they would be made to give it back.and since when can i decide i like your house , kick you out , fraudelently change the deed to the house into my name , move in to the house and claim it as mine . tell my newphew ( the president judge of the maori land court ) to dissmiss you out of court . then when i am caught make the taxpayer pay you and allow myself to keep the land.by the way 85 % of the south island was fraudelently taken / sold by the whiteman , 33ooo people own that land they were each given only $ 50 each in 1995 compensate by the tax payer for losing 85 % of the south island , hon mp carters farm is worth $ 10 million dollars can you believe he gave maori $ 50 for for 150 years of loss of income / businessby the way the majority of the parlimentarians of today still own that south island land , notice how they are all farmersgovernment made you pay us so they did'nt have to and they are only getting richer , and you smart whiteman fell for it it hook line and sinkerthe crown issued a order to the police to gun down(slaughter ) 2000 maori people at a sunday mass in a church . the government then split up the survivors of that family ( most were made slaves down south . ) others were burnt alive in the church . other family members were found in mass graves . the children were put into maori schools that taught them how to clean english peoples houses.the crown then said how conveniant look " absentee owners , now we can sell the land to ourselves and sold the 2000 peoples lands to them selves judges , laywers , politicians , police constables . related to people such as helen clarke ( first prime minister of nz was helen clarkes great great grandfather , who still own land in the same place . alot of mps / judges / laywyers past and future own huge farms / lands . so you know what the government does , helen clarke does'nt want to give that land back , so she gets the new zealand taxpayer to componsate maori for all the hardship , and yet she still keeps the land . do you really think we want the nz taxpayer to fund us ? we want the palimentarian familes from the past ( yes most are related to the mps of today ) give the land back that they used from abuse of power.they are doing it right under your nose . talk about a conflict of intrest the crown gets you to pay us and they keep there land.masters/grey/fox/carter/clarke/judge gilfidor are responsible for all the fraud in maori land , and they own 85 % of farms in new zealand , new zealandaverage whiteman as still getting screwed right under your nose . who do you think owns the lands the government wants you to compansate maori tribes with ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? yeah that s right the mps own the land and they are getting you the tax payer to pay for it . maori want the mp / crown to be held personally responsible . they want you to hate maori it works in there favour they get to keep the land they fraudulently ownps to all you people who believe maori are a drain on our economy , maori businesses earned nz $ 2.7 billion last year the cost of maori on winz benefit was 1.98 billion , so we are paying for our selves thank you very much.maori make up 50 % of the prision population i find this interestinga white man stabs and kills a 14 year old maori boy for spray painting on his shed . his defence was " he ran into the knife " . the judge sentenced him to 2 years with parole ( parole thirds his sentence)in total he gets 1 year 4 monthsbeacause we are your scape goats and we do n't blame you you are to stupid to figure out how the government is screwing you over.by the way to answer your question on maori make up 50%of the prision population , prisions are run by private companys the more prisioners the more money taxpayers pay to the prision company . hhhhhmmmm now who do you think owns who owns large shares in the private prision companys ..... thats right alot of mps ( yes the same who stole land ) are part owners of prision company explain why the average sentence for a violent offence is 2.3 years longer for maori then pakeha . we understand american culture , yes some maori were treated and made slaves by english ( most were made to live in caves and most died of hypothermia , and yes english have always referred to maori throughout history as " niggers " ( captain cooks log)explain why maori leave schoolbecause most teachers hold the same attitude as you . funny how the success rate for maori sky rocket when they are in maori schools , and your stereotypical view of maori being a drop out no longer workswe want you to learn not the maori history of nz but the actual history of nz . we have never asked for maori lanaguage to be compulsary in schools , and back in the day maori children where beaten by teachers if they spoke any maori . the government refused to recognise the maori language until 1986 , they recognised sign lanague in 1985 . why is'nt history taught in school because if the average whiteman realised what the government had done and are still doing to this day you would be outraged.the reason you wo n't research is because you would not longer be able to use maori as scapegoats you would have us to blame for everything that is wrong in new zealand , from my veiw point everything was fine before pakeha arrived and started stealing.i will put it to you , if i stole your house ten years ago ( the same way the english stole ours ) , do you still consider it your house and want ownershipback . what about in twenty years on . what if in the meantime i sell it on to someone else ? do you still consider that your house , what about in fifity years timemaori do not get cheaper university fees and extra benefits , are you for real ? maori are not given any extra benefits , for those of you that believe the government gives us extra money , you have to be kidding right ? the government has not,/and never has / never will give us extra money or cheaper fees and i challenge you to prove that they have ... the government has never granted maori grants or scholarships with nz tax money . maori scholarships / grants are funded by our own families who are part owners of large corporations / estates / companys / trusts /farms / family businesse etc . part of all the profits made in all our businesses are put aside for all family members to use to pay for university costs.if your family / extended family owns a business ask them to put some of profit made from their business into an account and then you can have the benefit of grants and scholarships too for pakeha.as my mother works in studylink there are more scholarships and grants for pakeha then maori infact the government pays for a website for pakeha grants / scholarship , but surprising they do not post a website for maorithe government does not pay for the website for maori grants and scholarships , by the way alot of maori grants / scholarships can be granted even if you are not maori , this is not the same for pakeha grants and scholorships.4 . we have been more than generous , maori people gifted all the land on which all hospitals / schools / universites sit on now . we contractual gifted the land on the condition that the crown uses the land for the benefit of all new zealanders to recieve free health care / free education . we did not support the move to student loans we maori belived that all new zealanders are entittled to free education , we wanted our lands back as the lands the universities were on were now being used for profit , ( again have a look at the board of trustees for the university , guess who they are related to , and guess who really profits out of student loans . not nz who do you think recieves the fees yep the same people who stole land years ago)we maori were fighting for the intrests of the nz people as a whole , but because in the past we have been made to be the so called " land grabbers " you could not see the whole picture.5 . why do maoris hate schools?lets look from the past to now5 generations back children were " schooled " how to clean whitemans houses4 generations back , maori children were used to farm white peoples land ( under the education act)3 generations back , children were beaten by teachers for speaking maori ( grandmother / parents)2 generations back , maori rascism prevalant in most schools(see united nation report on human rights discrimination)maoris are paid almost $ 2.37 below the average whiteman in the same job with the same quailificationsmaoris are paid $ 1.83 less than a white female in the same role.by the way for all you idiots out there land titles ( ownership papers ) were made before the treaty was signed , we had the titles to our land before the new zealand land wars , the new zealand land wars was because the maori people were doing their best to get their land back , and no not because we sold it for blankets and muskets ( again where did you guys hear this ? ? ? ? duh maori did have land titles before 1840 ( treaty of waitangi ) and all sales of lands were documented properly . by the way if you studied nz history you would realise that maori did not have a word for " sale (I, 0.9555) " . show me a title where blankets and muskets where the payment for land.the fraud was made through the tittle , when pakeha changed titles made fake wills , maori could'nt do a bloody thing because maori were not allowed entry to tittle offices ( another great law care of nz government)even when maori wanted to sell land they would take the maori persons name eg tamihana ( wairapa ) and sell all land from every tamihana in new zealand . ( eg if you are smith , i would serch out evey smith in new zealand and sell all land owned by smith.also supposedly maori recieve extra benefits on a winz benefit are you kidding , if you live in a white area ( parnell ) you get up to $ 400 per week to pay your mortgate and up to$150 per week accomodation plus $ 130 per week for the unemployment benefitnow if you are a maori house owner in otara you recieve no mortgage payment , up to $ 65 accomodation supplement and $ 130 unemployment benefit . maori are expected to sell there house . check it out for yourself . maori do not choose to live in otara the government chooses where you live . this is avalible through winz websiteif you are on the unemployment benefit why are whiteman still in places like parnell and central auckland having their mortgage paid by the government . so before you pick on the $ 65 per week maori have a look at the $ 465 a week whiteman on the unemployment benefit ( that equates to 7 maori benefits for every 1 white person)do your homework people it is staring you in the facethe national average for unemployment rate for pakeha and maori was 3.8 for the population this year as the reccession hit jobs around the country were being cut maori unemployment rates reached 7.8 in 6 months , considering maori only make up 17 % of the population , can you explain why most jobs cut / lost were maori workers.you believe that maori has an attitude of entiltlement , where does your sense of entiltlement come from , as a whiteman are you entiltiled to use and profit from maori owned resources and claim ownership as you wish.you are entittled to comment on people knowing nothing about history . of course we know what was happening at the time.we own individual titles to the sea bed and foreshore which now belong to the crown , how much of that is been sold?to you redneck pakeha i do feel sorry for you , only in the sense that you have no idea what is going on right infront of you , every day you work you work to line mps family you will never share in that wealth , they own new zealand they run new zealand in line with their own business objectives . who controlls the price of milk , who owns the farms ? ? ? ? who owns the factory that processes the milk????who owns the company that runs the prisons ? ? ? ? why do you think that john keys is pushing prisioners convicted on charges that hold sentences of less than 2 years can be found guilty ( without a jury ) that is the fundamental princple in democracry trial by jury . but this gives john keys the power to aquire many prisioners at one time.for those that believe that because we are maori and there are no full blooded maori left and we have diluted bloodlines i am a half cast maori and i live maori culture everyday , i know who my family / relations are 65 generations back . it is about a sense of identity , not bloodline . a cultrually pakeha will never understand that . pakeha have no undrstanding of culture because you have never had one.alot of pakeha believe them to be at the hieght of sophistication , pakeha did not bathe for months at a time pakeha tried aboriginale genecide beliving that if aboriginal should marry a pakeha the aboriginal feature would disapear.pakeha would feed babies water and flour mix ( creating a paste making sore stomachs ) pakeha have ruined each country they have ever been in.i am taught to respect my elders , i do n't put them in nursing homes and visit them once a year , the entire family cares for them and visits them often , i am never lonely . iam not greedy and use people . i do not treat people as 2nd class citizens , i do nt not comment on something that is 150 years old that has absolutely nothing to do with me . maoris have a relationship with the people affected by the treaty thaey are our grandfather / great great grandfathers , they are our parents , our grandchildren , our family , when the government burns you family to death in a church at sunday prayer would you be forgiving????????we are invovled in many maori charitable orgs . i have seen what english culture has done to most other cultures around the world and what it has done to familys around new zealand , lost generations of australia , attempted genocide of aboriginals , india ( mughal pandy ) revolt started when english manufacture bullets in wrappers made with pig / cowfat , gave it to hindu / muslims ( to open the seal they needed to open it with thier mouths ) which was entirely against there religion . africa ( need i say more ) american indians 5 million american indians killed for land ( more than the holocaust)english people have burnt maori people in churchesenglish in london were still sentencing 5 year old children to prison.english have rascially discriminated againt polynesian and asian over time too . there are churches in new zealand with mass gravesbut yet we are savages because we ate the flesh of another human . are the people who survied the airplane crash ..... savages ? ( you know the white guys ones who ate human flesh 1986 ? ) so its ok when you eat human flesh , they do n't get ostraized in1986 , but maori do because they did it 900 years before.as english you believe you have the right to take the moral highground , let me tell you your moral compass does not point due north and you have no right telling maori what is morraly wrong with thier culture ( again look at yours first)pakeha give the men of war who sacrificed their life for new zealands freedoom now live on a pension of $ 202 per weekand apparently we are diluted maoris on your statistics that would mean that 50 % of the prison population is actually in fact white man . funny that , statistically if it benefits the county i am considered a pakeha new zealander , if it is a statictic that has anything to do with ministry of justice i am a maori.by the way maori people hold titles to the foreshore and seabed , they will forever . the reason why helen clark was able to pass it and snatch yet more land of maori , was she said maori were rioting outside parliment . a riot act mean she can enforced a bill immedialtey . she wanted the foreshore / seabed , maori had a peacefull protest . can anyone tell me where we were rioting.you still believe that we recievce better treatment then pakeha . we recivce less money , less benefits , less respect , less education . we signed a treaty and unfortunatley for all you out there that mean that nz government has to abide by it .
